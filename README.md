### Description

The 3D Toolkit is a collection of programs that allow working with 3D point cloud data. The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called "show" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of "tools", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China. Know-how from 3DTK influenced several businesses from car manufacturers to mineral excavation or archaeological projects.

### Description

The Amahi Linux Home Server makes your home networking and storage simple. We like to call the Amahi servers HDAs, for "Home Digital Assistants." Each HDA delivers all the functionality you would want in a home server, while being easy to use from a web browser and mobile apps.

Amahi can turn popular Linux distributions into a simple to use networking, storage and app server. The server management is done through a friendly user interface (the "platform”). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.

The installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.

Once the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR "engine") and some are very popular open source apps and services.

### Description

There are around 7,000 languages in the world today, around half of which are written. Most language technology is only available for a tiny fraction of these. Certainly under 1%. Apertium is a project which aims to help create language technology, particularly machine translation systems for the other 99%. Because most of the languages we work with have very little in the way of existing translations, we rely on making the most of all kinds of different resources from written grammars to dictionaries, corpus collections and help from native speakers and activists.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: * __Be realistic__: We're more likely to accept ideas which are realistic than ones which are "way out there". But if you have a "way out there" idea, don't panic! We're still interested, but we'll try to find a subset of it which is achievable in the time scale available.
* __Be appropriate__: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.
* __Have a plan__: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Show you have a definite plan with dates and deliverables split into weeks.
* __Get in contact ASAP!__: We get a lot of proposals: some good, most bad. Get in contact with your potential mentor '''as soon as possible''' by sending your proposal to the mailing list, and asking for feedback. Be responsive to feedback. Refine your application based on feedback. If the mentors remember you, your chances of being picked are higher. 
* __Read the Ideas Page!__: If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read [[Ideas for Google Summer of Code|the ideas page]]. Read the ideas page.
* __Do the coding challenge__: Every idea will have a coding challenge to perform, this is basically a test to see if you have the required skills to do the project or if you can acquire them in a short amount of time.

### Description

# Overview

appleseed is an open source, physically-based global illumination rendering engine primarily designed for animation and visual effects.

appleseed is actively developed since 2012 by a small, international team of talented volunteers from the animation and VFX industry. Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.

Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).

# Features

appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.

appleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage), RGB and spectral rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.

Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine’s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: # Skills

appleseed is a large project that spans a variety of disciplines such as graphics and system programming, user interface design or applied physics. You can make meaningful contributions without being a rendering expert.

However, appleseed and related applications are all written primarily in portable C++, consequently fluency with C++ is a requirement for all projects.

# How to apply

1. Join [Slack](https://slackin-naplrzjfoz.now.sh/). Feel free to choose any nickname but **please fill in your real first and last names**.
2. **Join the #gsoc-general channel and introduce yourself**. Tell us about projects you have been working on in your spare (if any), your past involvement with open source communities (if any), why you chose appleseed, and the project(s) you are interested in.
3. **You will also need to build appleseed on your machine**. Please follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/wiki/Building-appleseed). Please reach out on Slack in #help if you need help.
3.

### Description

The BEAM Community is a group of OSS projects that run on the Erlang VM. Our goal is to host relevant projects in the Erlang community, making it easy for those projects to participate in the Google Summer of Code and for interested students to pick their best choice. The Erlang VM was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.

Many companies around the world like Amazon, Heroku and Activision use the Erlang VM in their stack and open source projects like ejabberd, Riak, Phoenix, CouchDB, Zotonic, Nerves project and many more are built on top of it. Our currently hosted projects include the Elixir programming language, BarrelDB, a distributed database, LASP, a language for Distributed Eventually consistent computations, and ejabberd, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others. This gives students a wide range of choices, that goes from working on distributed systems, to maintaining robust servers and language design.

### Description

Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:

* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,
* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,
* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,
* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.

# Python native
If Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. 

# Platform native
It's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.

# More than just code
We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: To begin the application process, fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gcnGF28SuxbezZj72), providing your resume, and an essay, **no more than 1 page in length**, that covers the following three points:

* Tell your story. In particular, what led you to your current area of study?
* Why are you applying to the GSoC? In particular, why are you applying to the BeeWare Project?
* If you could build any cross-platform application (mobile, desktop or both) - what would you build?

We will blind review these initial applications to develop a short list of interesting applicants. We will invite those on the shortlist to complete a video interview. We will invite some interviewees to complete a short project, and develop a full project proposal. We will assess the process of working with you on this small project, and the quality of your project proposal, and use that as the basis for our slot request to the GSoC program.

It will be in your interest to start this application process early. If you submit your initial application hours before the GSoC application deadline, we won't have enough time to evaluate you fully.

### Description

The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University was founded to explore cyberspace, share in its study, and help pioneer its development. We represent a network of faculty, students, fellows, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and virtual architects working to identify and engage with the challenges and opportunities of cyberspace.

We investigate the real and possible boundaries in cyberspace between open and closed systems of code, of commerce, of governance, and of education, and the relationship of law to each. We do this through active rather than passive research, believing that the best way to understand cyberspace is to actually build out into it.

Our faculty, fellows, students, and affiliates engage with a wide spectrum of Net issues, including governance, privacy, intellectual property, antitrust, content control, and electronic commerce. Our diverse research interests cohere in a common understanding of the Internet as a social and political space where constraints upon inhabitants are determined not only through the traditional application of law, but, more subtly, through technical architecture ("code").

As part of our active research mission, we build, use, and freely share open software platforms for free online lectures and discussions. We also sponsor gatherings, ranging from informal lunches to international conferences, that bring together members of our diverse network of participants to swap insights – and sometimes barbs – as they stake out their respective visions for what the Net can become. We also teach, seeking out online and global opportunities, as well as supporting the traditional Harvard Law School curriculum, often in conjunction with other Harvard schools and MIT.

### Description

Blender is the free/open source 3D creation software for everyone, providing individuals and small teams a complete pipeline for 3D graphics, modeling, animation and games.

Blender is being made by 100s of active volunteers from all around the world; by studios and individual artists, professionals and hobbyists, scientists and students, vfx experts and animators, and so on.

All of them are united by an interest to have access to a fully free/open source 3D creation pipeline. Blender Foundation supports and facilitates these goals - even employs a small staff for that - but fully depends on the online community to achieve it.

Since 2005, Blender has organized a dozen short open films and a game project, which helped Blender tremendously to get more accepted by professionals in their daily work.

We invite students to think of ways to help us with this further. If your passion is with 3D coding, creativity tools, scientific simulation, or anything related to Computer Graphics in general, feel welcome to join us!

Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.

We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries are included in the C++ Standards Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) and in the new C++11 Standard. C++11 also includes several more Boost libraries in addition to those from TR1. More Boost libraries are proposed for standardization in C++17.

Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference related to Boost called C++ Now has been held in Aspen, Colorado each May. Boost has been a participant in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: After many extremely successful years of GSoC at Boost during, we are minded to keep in place the more rigorous candidate selection process which involves selecting every GSoC Boost candidate with a C++ programming test or provides links to at least 1,000 lines (excluding comments and whitespace) C++ library (not application nor solution) open source code. Then student shoud do the following:
1. Review the list of ideas from previous GSoC (https://svn.boost.org/trac10/wiki/SoCPrevious), the archives of the Boost mailing list (http://www.boost.org/community/groups.html#main) relating to GSoC.
2. Join the Boost mailing list and find a mentor who is an experienced Boost developer in one of the Boost libraries (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/) and subscribe at http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost
3. Read all posts tagged [gsoc18], then students should write a well researched and intelligent message with [gsoc18] at the front of the subject line to the mailing list seeking a mentor interested so that to write a GSoC proposal to be submitted to Google.
4. Once a potential mentor and project idea is found, the student must write a project proposal which should follow this submission template https://svn.boost.org/trac10/wiki/SoCSubmissionTemplate

Potential mentors may add precanned project ideas with programming competency tests to this page below as GSoC approaches. These may prove useful in starting a discussion with potential mentor(s) whom the student should approach directly.

### Description

Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system. At the same time, we are adding state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures to increase the speed and flexibility of XIA. We hope that this iterative refinement will make XIA an enticing choice for the future of networking.

The XIA project was established in 2010 as a collaboration between Boston University (BU), Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Duke University. Linux XIA, the native implementation of XIA in the Linux kernel, became a project member of Software Freedom Conservancy in 2016.

Pranav Goswami, one of our previous students, has summarized the growth experience that GSoC has brought to him and other of our students in the following testimonial:

“Working in GSoC as a student (2015) and then as a mentor (2017) for Linux XIA has been rewarding in many aspects and, throughout this journey, I have grown a lot and learned a lot.  Starting out as a student, I was guided very proficiently by Michel, Qiaobin, John, and Cody throughout the program. This, in turn, boosted my confidence and improved my communication as well as coding standard. It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees. This experience has helped me develop my overall profile. As a GSoC organization, I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you, XIA team!”

### Description

The Montreal [C3G](http://computationalgenomics.ca/) node is hosted at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center (MUGQIC).
The Montreal node is strongly involved with [GenAP](https://genap.ca/) and has developed several genomic data analysis pipelines.
Since 2011, we have completed more than 400 bioinformatics analysis projects with over 290 distinct groups of researchers across Canada.
Our teams have significant experience in personalized medicine applications.
These have included genome analysis and interpretation of personal genomes,
technology and services to record patient presentations, RNA- and ChIP-seq data analysis, and analysis of complete human epigenomes in both germline disorders and cancers.
Each year C3G co-organizes several international workshops about next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis.

The Montreal C3G node develops the [GenAP Pipes](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/mugqic_pipelines) which consist of Python scripts which create a list of jobs running Bash commands to analyze NGS data.
Those scripts support dependencies between jobs and a smart restart mechanism if some jobs fail during pipeline execution.
Job commands and parameters can be modified through several configuration files.
We currently maintain 7 pipelines and are in the process of developing 3 others.

The Montreal C3G node also develops other bioinformatics tools:
 
 * [BVAtools](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/bvatools)
 * [POPsv](https://github.com/jmonlong/PopSV)
 * [SCoNEs](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/scones)

### Description

The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.
The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.
Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.
We also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.

### Description

CCExtractor is originally an organization about subtitles and accessibility (our "official" description below). However, we're doing lots of other things that are related, including tinkering with open video hardware (JokerTV), imaging (OCR), and more. So we have projects that cover a range of interests, despite our core tool being the most amazing subtitle extractor.

And now, the official description: Whether it's because you are learning a new language, have hearing problems or just at a loud place, subtitles are an essential part of enjoying TV and movies for a a lot of people. There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but when it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. If you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Your application should include (in no specific order; you can organize it as you wish) 1) Your GitHub profile and/or links to anything you've worked in the past (doesn't need to be related to what we do), 2) Links to some solved issues in CCExtractor, 3) An introduction about yourself and your motivation to work with us specifically 4) What your expectations are participating in GSoC.

Make sure you join us in slack before submitting your application. We've never accepted any application, no matter how good it looked on paper, from a student we've never heard from.

If you have participated in code-in or GSoC in the past, please mention it.

### Description

The Center for Research In Open Source Software (CROSS) at the University of California in Santa Cruz (UCSC) aims to bridge the gap between student research and open source software projects. CROSS turns OSS prototypes into successful open source software projects. The Center was created in 2015 inspired by the story of UCSC alumni (and CROSS benefactor) Sage Weil, who turned his research prototype into a multi-million dollar company.  We draw from this expertise of our affiliated experts and industry members to choose projects that will have maximum real world impact. Our projects--which typically center around the work of senior graduate students and post-docs-- are mentored and guided by a team of experts chosen specifically to best ensure success.

CROSS uses a combination of teaching, networking, research and incubation of open source projects. Our industry members include Micron, Huawei, Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. CROSS 
currently supports seven open source software projects-- three research projects and two incubator projects. 

These projects currently include:
- ZLog: Distributed Shared-log for Software-defined Storage (Research)
- Smart Storage Devices in Genomics (Research)
- Mantle: A Programmable Metadata Load Balancer for the Ceph File System (Research)
- Strong Consistency in Dynamic Wireless Networks to Enable Safe and Efficient Navigation of Autonomous Vehicles (Research)

### Description

CERN-HSF (High-Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.

CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.

The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.

The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: In order to apply to CERN-HSF, please visit the following website:
http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html
There you will find a list of proposals for each project, their description and the contact information of their mentors. To see a list of all the project proposals sorted in alphabetical order, please visit:
http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/2018/summary.html
Once you have chosen one or more proposals that you like, please contact the corresponding mentors and they will guide you through the next steps.
Mentors will typically ask you to complete a technical test to evaluate if you have the skills required for the project. Please note that the vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge; in case of doubt, ask the mentors.
If you do well in the tests, mentors will usually ask you to write a description for your project and help you with the submission.

### Description

We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).

The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of _pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.

Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count = "hello";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.

The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type systems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other people have created [many more](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).

The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome your contribution!

### Description

We develop the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it is revolutionizing the study of the ancient world. It is doing so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).

Due to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars discover the commonalities of what were once thought disparate cultures.

As software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version-controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre-trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models), we provide easy-to-use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: See our [Project ideas page](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas) for a list of tasks that are suited to three months' work for a beginning-to-intermediate programmer. Most work needs to be written in Python or JavaScript, of which an intermediate-level knowledge is expected. For all projects, we ask that you carefully read and follow the our [GSoC proposal template](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/GSoC-proposal-template).

For a project focused on a Classical language, it is a requirement that you have an intermediate-level knowledge of that language. If you do not know much about NLP, that is fine, the mentors can work with you on this. If you know a Classical language that is not yet supported well by the CLTK (e.g., Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), you may follow the pattern set by the current Greek and Latin libraries. See [the docs](http://docs.cltk.org/en/latest) for an idea of what functionalities we have for various languages. 

For those not familiar with an ancient language, we would like to see a web project that builds off the work (both in JavaScript) of two previous GSoC students. In 2016, a text reading environment was created. In 2017, a text-serving backend and annotation framework, both specifically build to handle the diverse conventions of pre-modern texts, were added to this reading environment. For 2018, we would like to see the work of the previous summers turned into fully abstracted and added as libraries into the npm registry. See the Project ideas page for full technical details.

If you are unsure of how to contribute, please reach out to us on Gitter or Google Groups.

### Description

The Computational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics Research Group of the University of Antwerp (CLiPS, http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be) focuses on applications of statistical and machine learning methods, trained on corpus data, to explain human language acquisition and processing data, and to develop automatic text analysis systems that are accurate, efficient, and robust enough to be used in practical applications.

There are 3 subgroups to CLiPS: (1) the sociolinguistics group studies language variation in different demographic groups. The (2) psycholinguistics group studies the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on (3) the computational linguistics group.

Current research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.

Over the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Don't write a tweet, but don't write a book either. Try to write an engaging two pager, with flowing paragraphs of concise sentences that don't use 'would', 'could' or 'should'. 

Tell us a little bit about yourself. What are you studying and why? Where do you want to be in 10 years from now? Do you believe robots will ever have feelings? How many years have you been writing code? (we like Python, and possibly C to speed things up). Do you have other relevant skills (languages, psychology, statistics, visualization, web development, project management, lawmaking ...)? You can also add your cv, but these are tedious to examine and difficult to compare. We prefer that you first of all write something engaging about yourself!

Tell us how you will tackle the challenge. Be bold, tell us about your own ideas on how we should be dealing with the challenge. Talk about things that you want to do, not what you think we want to hear. Propose a rough timeline with some goals and intermediate milestones. Don't add a lengthy day-to-schedule – plans tend to change. Mention any papers you have read or published on the topic. Tell us what ML algorithms, NLP techniques and open source toolkits you know of.

If you fear that you don't have the required skills and knowledge, but you really, really want to be involved, tell us why, and think of ways you can contribute while learning the ropes. Motivation is very contagious.

### Description

CloudCV is an open source cloud platform led by graduate students and faculty at the Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Georgia Tech, with the aim of making AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.
  
CloudCV consists of three major platforms: 

**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.

**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.

**EvalAI** is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.

### Description

coala: Language Independent Code Analysis

coala provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.

# How does it work?

With coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.

# For Users

coala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.

# For Developers

You can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.

# For Newcomers

coala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Guidance for applying to coala can be found in our [FAQ](http://projects.coala.io/#/faq) and dedicated [gsoc](https://gitter.im/coala/coala/gsoc) gitter room.

### Description

Our group works at the interface of computer science, biology, and mathematics by applying computational approaches to the seas of data in biomedical research. One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.

Other technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.

Our group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.

### Description

After four years of development the Android Jabber/XMPP client is mostly feature complete for now. However an instant messaging client in a federated ecosystem like Jabber is only as good as the rest of the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs good desktop clients, it needs good servers and good providers who maintain their servers and keep them up to date with the latest features. Conversations.im as an umbrella organization is about bringing improvements to that ecosystem. Partially by improving existing clients and servers but also by creating tools that aid server administrators to maintain their servers and that aid end users to pick a good, stable provider. Those tools include the XMPP Compliance Tester or the XMPP uptime monitor. We have a [collection of ideas](https://conversations.im/gsoc.html) that we think will improve the end user experience, but we are also very open to hearing other ideas that we didn’t think of ourself. Have you always thought about creating a service that will look up phone numbers and return Jabber IDs or otherwise improve the discoverable of contacts? Great. Let us hear your ideas and we might be able to find a suitable mentor for you. Want to add a new feature to an existing client? Great we will put you in touch with the appropriate mentors. Want to start developing your own client? Probably not a very good idea since every platform already has a client that awaits your help.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Conversations puts a lot of focus on user experience so we encourage you to become a user of XMPP first.
To become a user you need to:

* Download an XMPP client ([Conversations](https://conversations.im) on Android and [Gajim](https://gajim.org) or [Dino](https://dino.im) on Windows and Linux)
* Create an account on an XMPP server. For startes we recommend creating an account on the conversations.im server. In both Gajim and Conversations you can tick the checkbox Create new account during initial setup.

After downloading a client and creating an account please join the conversations group chat (MUC) under the address: xmpp:gsoc@conference.conversations.im?join.

Details on what we expect the actual proposal to look like can be found at the bottom of our [ideas page](https://conversations.im/gsoc.html).

Please note that those ideas are only inspirations. You can submit any project proposal that you believe will bring value to the XMPP ecosystem. Be it tools that help server admins create better servers, add a specific feature to a specific XMPP server or client or tools that somehow improve the usability for end users. In a way we even appreciate it even more if you submit your own ideas instead of copy pasting one of ours because it shows that you have investment in the XMPP ecosystem.

### Description

The mission of the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) is to collect, preserve and make available images, text and metadata of all artifacts inscribed with the cuneiform script. It is the sole project with this mission and we estimate that our 334,000 catalogue entries cover some two-thirds of all sources in collections around the world. Our data are available publicly at https://cdli.ucla.edu and our audiences comprise primarily scholars and students, but with growing numbers of informal learners. 

At the heart of cdli is a group of developers, language scientists, machine learning engineers, and cuneiform specialists who develop software infrastructure to process and analyze curated data. To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.

### Description

The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.

DBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.

DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about.

We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Would you like to apply for our projects? Please follow this rough guideline:

1) Subscribe to the DBpedia-GSoC mailing list: https://tinyurl.com/y7cfbr8n All GSoC related questions must go through this list.

### Description

The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system.

 Debian GNU/Linux is:

* Full featured: Users can select which packages to install; Debian provides a tool for this purpose. You can find a list and descriptions of the packages currently available in Debian at any of the Debian mirror sites.
* Free to use and redistribute: There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License.
* The Debian FTP archives also carry approximately 696 software packages (in the non-free and contrib sections), which are distributable under specific terms included with each package.
* Dynamic: With about 1033 volunteers constantly contributing new and improved code, Debian is evolving rapidly. The FTP archives are updated twice every day.

Although Debian GNU/Linux itself is free software, it is a base upon which value-added Linux distributions can be built. By providing a reliable, full-featured base system, Debian provides Linux users with increased compatibility, and allows creators to eliminate duplication of effort and focus on the things that make their distribution special. 

A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.

Debian comes with over 51,000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.

It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.

### Application Instructions

### Description

Developers Italia is a community dedicated to the development of Open Source Software, created to support Italian digital public services.

It is a radical change in the way the Public Administration operates. Everything we are doing is operating with open standards and software, we are creating **SDKs** for the main programming languages and frameworks, we craft publicly documented **APIs**. We contribute to open projects, and the people we contract to improve the technology become **Open Source developers**.

Most of the code is deployed within the Italian public institutions, but it is meant to be generic, in the hope that it will be useful to many other people around the world. Around these tools we are engaging a community of developers and innovators, **inside and outside Italy**, that can participate in all aspects of the creation of the new digital infrastructure.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: # Remember: all ideas on the ideas page are... ideas! You can come up with your own proposal!
Here's a short list to ensure you're applying the best way you can
- Join the [Slack of Developers Italia](https://slack.developers.italia.it), introduce yourself, and meet your fellow developers
- Read [Google's instructions for participating](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and the [GSoC Student Manual](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/manual#student_manual)
- Take a look at the list of ideas
- Come up with project that you're interested in
- Write a first draft proposal and get someone to review it
- Remember: you must link to work such as commits in your proposal
- Read [How to write a kickass proposal for GSoC](http://teom.org/blog/kde/how-to-write-a-kick-ass-proposal-for-google-summer-of-code/)
- Submit your proposal and all necessary documents well ahead of the deadline

A good start is finding out what the most pressing issues are in the projects in which you are interested. 
Check out the github issues as well as join the relevant slack channels: meet developers and your potential mentor, as well as start learning the codebase. We recommend strongly getting involved in advance of the beginning of GSoC, and we will look favorably on applications from students who have already started to act like Open Source developers.

Always remember: this is a very brief instruction list - in any case of any doubts, just reach out to us, we're very happy to help new developers get started!

### Description

Django is a high-level Python Web framework originally developed at the Lawrence-Journal World. Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: We'll be looking for a few things in your application:.

- You'll need to have a concrete task in mind along with a solid idea of what will constitute "success" (you tell us).
- If your proposal is a single large feature, library or site, you'll need to present a detailed design specification. This proposal should be posted to ​django-developers, where it can be refined until it is accepted by the developer community.
- We'll want to know a bit about you -- links to previous work are great, if any. If you're proposing something ambitious, you'll need to convince us that you're up to the task.
- You'll also need to provide us with a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones so your mentor can know if and when to nag you :)

Here's an example of an accepted proposal from a previous year:

​https://gist.github.com/chrismedrela/82cbda8d2a78a280a129 

When you contribute code, you will be expected to adhere to the same contribution guidelines as any other code contributor. This means you will be expected to provide extensive tests and documentation for any feature you add, you will be expected to participate in discussion on ​django-developers when your topic of interest is raised. If you're not already familiar with ​Django's contribution guidelines, now would be a good time to read them - even if you're not applying to work on Django core directly, we'll still want the same level of contribution.

### Description

Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.

It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.

The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.

The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.

Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Welcome, GSoC students! Please read Drupal's getting started guide for students @ https://www.drupal.org/node/2415225 completely which will provide you with all the necessary information before applying.

### Description

Eta is a pure functional language designed for practical use modelled after Haskell. It has a combination of purity, laziness and strong typing making developers highly productive. These features allow developers to focus more on describing their problem rather than focusing on how to give commands to a machine on how to accomplish their task.

Eta runs on the Java Virtual Machine allowing large companies to integrate it into their existing systems. It provides a type-safe Foreign Function Interface (FFI) mechanism that allows you to access existing Java, Scala, Clojure, and Groovy libraries with ease while keeping the nice properties of the language.

Eta shares the compiler infrastructure with GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, which means it already has sophisticated optimizations that allow you to write high level code and get good performance as well.

Eta's runtime has a wide variety of concurrency mechanisms such as Software Transactional Memory, MVars, and Fibers to allow developers to build highly complex concurrent & distributed systems with ease.

### Description

The Fedora Project's core values, or Foundations, are Freedom, Friends, Features, & First. Read more about them here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Foundations

A key component of this is our **Community**. This community, which you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is creating a platform that supports the work of a diverse audience. Your contributions can affect people you've never met in situations you've never dreamed of. The Fedora community includes software engineers, artists, system administrators, web designers, writers, speakers, and translators -- all of whom will be happy to help you get started.

Full project description available here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview

We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and strength of our community.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Our application process is described completely here: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/mentored-projects/gsoc/2018/application.html

In general, we are looking for students to describe both their understanding of the project they are choosing (or their complete project if they are proposing one) and to help us understand why they are the best candidate for the project. This also includes helping us understand their availability and level of commitment. While prior experience with Fedora is ideal, it is not a selection requirement.

### Description

# What FFmpeg is

FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created.
It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge, no matter if these formats were designed by some standards committee, the community or a corporation.
FFmpeg compiles, runs, and passes our testing infrastructure FATE across Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build environments, platforms and configurations.
FFmpeg provides the libraries libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat, libavfilter, libavdevice, libswscale and libswresample to be used by applications as well as the command line tools ffmpeg, ffplay and ffprobe for direct use.

# Who the users of FFmpeg are

The FFmpeg libraries are utilized by various applications and services affecting the daily multimedia experience of countless end-users.
Among these are media players like VLC and MPlayer, browsers including Chromium and Firefox, social media services from Facebook and Twitter to YouTube and Vimeo.
Also a large user base uses the provided command line tools to directly record, manipulate and play media in all the many ways FFmpeg has to offer.
If digital multimedia is part of your daily life chances are high that you are already part of the huge group of people who benefit from the FFmpeg project.

# How your contribution might fit in

As an interested student you will have the chance to dive into a highly technical environment and demonstrate the necessary skills to develop software at a high level in terms of code quality, maintainability and security.
Having a mentor on your side reduces the burdon to get you on speed working in a yet unknown codebase and community.
You will be able to improve your skills, gain a lot of experience in a very interesting field and possibly contribute your own piece of a software that might have an impact on millions of users.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: # Requirements

We welcome students interested in audio, video and multimedia technology in general. Good knowledge of the C programming language or assembler and a basic understanding of the git revision control system are required.

We expect students to pass a qualification task to get accepted. Passing this task will prove that you know how to program in C (or assembler), that you can handle git and - most importantly - that you are able to communicate with us on the mailing list and understand our sometimes complex review process.

Therefore, it is important to get in touch with us as early as possible. Your qualification task is object to the very same review process like every other patch. Usually, many iterations are needed to make a patch acceptable which will take time.

# Apply

Best to prepare your proposal is to get to know our community and communication channels. Subscribe to our development mailing list and join #ffmpeg-devel on the freenode IRC network. You will already be able to gain a lot of insight about us, our rules and procedures by just following discussions on these channels.

Next, write your potential mentor an initial mail to actually dive into your application. Be elaborative about yourself and your interest in the project so that your mentor can adapt to your capabilities in the best possible way. Your mentor will then guide you through your qualification task and possibly through all the rest of a successful Summer of Code.

### Description

FOSSology is an industry standard tool for the end-to-end analysis of software distributions. It lets organizations scan source code for: a) License information, b) Copyright notices, c) Export control relevant statements. It makes software analysis more efficient by offering high precision with few false positives, greatly reducing overhead costs.

FOSSology is a framework, toolbox and Web server application for examining software packages in a multi-user environment. A user can upload individual files or entire software packages. Fossology will unpack this upload if necessary and run a chosen set of agents on every file of the upload. An agent can implement any analysis operation on a text file. The FOSSology package as of now focuses on license relevant data. However, it could be extended with analyses for different purposes (e.g. static code analysis).

FOSSology lets users generate licensing documentation according to the organization's needs, in a variety of data formats, emphasizing SPDX tag-value and RDF documents. FOSSology is an Open Source Software tool licensed under GPL-2.0 and a Linux Foundation collaboration project.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: There are a couple of ways to start the FOSSology development, for example by checking out the source repo and build the vagrant machine by issuing a "vagrant up" command (a tool like VirtualBox and also Vagrant installed). The vagrant machine shares the source repo so it acts as standardized deployment environment.

Please review the requirements described in the project ideas page at https://wiki.fossology.org/gsoc-2018


You could submit your proposals using the GSoC website to the mentor from the ideas page. Please feel free to contact them directly with questions.

### Description

We are a group of developers and open hardware enthusiasts from the open source silicon community, that formed the FOSSi Foundation. It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.

Our goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single "IP blocks" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org).

Beside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.

With those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of "open source chips". Please find a list of a few ideas, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.

Google Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference [ORConf](https://orconf.org) with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Gdansk, Poland, on September 21-23.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please choose projects that match your experience level and abilities. We highly encourage you to submit your own proposals. As we are an umbrella organization, the individual projects manage their own requirements. Please get in touch with the proposed mentors very early as some of the projects may require you to prove your capabilities.

Generally, we highly encourage you to get in touch with the projects early and thoroughly. The proposed mentory are happy to support you with understanding the proposed projects. They will also guide you on milestones and other planning parts of your application. You should be confident to being able to conduct the project and ask as many questions as you have!

### Description

FreeREG and FreeCEN are two projects run by Free UK Genealogy CIO (a Registered Charity in England and Wales).  Free UK Genealogy provides free access to historical data of interest to family historians and others. Over twenty years, thousands of volunteers have so far transcribed over 400 million records. The databases, search engines and user interfaces have largely largely designed and maintained by volunteers, who have been supported by a number of contractors and, more recently, a small team of support staff.  FreeREG uses mongodb, Ruby on Rails, and Refinery CMS.  FreeCEN is transitioning from mysql to mongodb, from php to Ruby on Rails, and does not have a CMS in its old interface (www.freecen.org.uk).  

For FreeREG, we are planning to use the summer to finish work on Version 1.5 Coordinator Enhancement - these are features which allow our volunteer coordinators to support the transcribers in their teams, and to monitor and maintain the quality of the transcription work.  We hope to have finished the tasks relating to the development of new communications systems (but there may be some bug fixing to do) and be working on improvements suggested by the coordinators. 

For FreeCEN, we are also  planning to use the summer to work on features for Coordinators - but this is at an earlier level.  Using our learning from FreeREG, we need to enable Coordinators to move on from outdated (and unstable) software for quality control, and undertake this using online tools. We are also beginning to explore how to offer the same functionality as www.freecen.org.uk (lots of ways to search!) on freecen2.freecen.org.uk - perhaps using AI.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please sign up to our Slack channel (https://goo.gl/forms/C8FptJ1rgjxnDDcz1- scroll to the bottom of page).  
Our mailing list is for a newsletter that every two months lets volunteers, users, and supporters know what we are doing - have a look at the archive (https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/about/pages/newsletter-archive/)
We’ve written a blog which explains how you might get involved with an Open Source project - including ours - and some more about our projects https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/news/2017/12/30/how-to-get-involved-with-open-source/

We’d like you to work on an issue that uses your current knowledge, and also expands your range.  Please see our ideas page, but you can also take a look at the current issues on our waffle boards https://waffle.io/freeukgen/freecenmigration (building the new FreeCEN) and https://waffle.io/freeukgen/myopicvicar (FreeREG) - if you filter by ‘SoC’ you will see the stories we think might interest you - but feel free to ask us about anything that is sitting in ‘Defined and Prioritised’ ‘Product Backlog’ that interests you. 

You are encouraged to try out our websites as a user before or during the summer  - maybe even become a transcriber - so you can suggest new ideas and paths which you can work on as well.

Upfront: could you help out with one of the ‘good first issue’ tasks from our waffle board? If you can replicate a bug  - can you look at the code and suggest where the problem might lie?  Suggest a solution?

### Description

FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.

The FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.

There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.  This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.

In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please look at our [instructions for applying with FreeBSD](https://gsoc.FreeBSD.org/) which includes lots of details on producing a good proposal that stands a better chance of being accepted.  We recommend that you submit your proposals as early as possible, as that gives us the opportunity to comment on your proposals and allow you to refine them.  We also recommend that you discuss proposals with possible mentors beforehand too in order to make sure your proposal is achievable and worthwhile.

### Description

More and more people are single-handedly installing and maintaining free networks. Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.

Umbrella Organisation
-----

We act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).

Local communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.

Hardware and Software
----

Most devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.
You can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.

Common freifunk goals
----

* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information
* Reducing the digital divide
* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources
* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks
* Promote and support existing and new social structures

As we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.

### Description

Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome in 2001 to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.

At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.

Today, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Start early and pay attention to Google's student manual and the timeline. Student application submission date is March 27th so do not get bitten by timezones or random internet outages.

### Description

The GENIVI Alliance provides standards and an open connectivity platform that accelerates innovative solutions based on open software for In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems and connected vehicles.

The alliance has built a strong a community where automotive experts and thought leaders from related industries (e.g., content providers, mobility, etc.) can collaborate to produce adoptable standards and open source code.  These collaborations are often based on industry trends that require collaborative development of solutions for increased functionality in automobiles.  GENIVI has become a community where ecosystems outside of the automotive industry can meet and leverage the global automaker and supplier network in the GENIVI membership.

GENIVI is accelerating innovation within the automotive ecosystem and driving initiatives founded on leading trends including system on a chip (SOC) consolidation, advanced user interfaces, software-over-the-air (SOTA), car-to-cloud connectivity and entertainment in autonomous vehicles. 

An example of automotive trends meeting open technology is the GENIVI Vehicle Domain Interaction Strategy. GENIVI, in collaboration with other global technology providers, is developing open standard interfaces and code that bridge multiple car software domains. 

GENIVI has also delivered multiple software components that have been adopted and deployed in production vehicles worldwide.  Developed by GENIVI, several standard interfaces (APIs) have been adopted in many commercial and open source solutions.  These software components and interfaces are combined into a buildable baseline (based on Yocto Project’s meta-ivi layer) as well.  This baseline is the basis of the GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) that is an open source, automotive development platform where prototypes and innovative IVI and connected vehicle solutions can be rapidly developed and tested.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: First thing you need to do is get in touch with potential mentors and let me them know about your interest. Second, you'll likely want to review GENIVI projects and a widely used integration target called [GDP](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11567210)

Since DBus is involved in many of the projects, you're advized to learn about it and play with it a bit in C++.

Please sign up for our mailing list: https://lists.genivi.org/mailman/listinfo/genivi-projects where the mentors participate.

Hang out on our IRC channel as much as possible: #automotive on irc.freenode.net . Please note that this channels is shared with Automated Grade Linux project.

### Description

Every user has work they need to do. The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.

Put another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.

The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Students interested in applying to do a project for Gentoo should join #gentoo-soc on the Freenode IRC network and the gentoo-soc@lists.gentoo.org mailing list. Announcements related to Gentoo's Summer of Code effort will be relayed to both places.

You can choose among our project ideas or come up with your own. The gentoo-soc mailing list, the gentoo-soc IRC channel or any of the listed mentors can provide feedback.

Write a proposal attempting to convince us why your project should be chosen. A few sentences are not sufficient in most cases to sway anyone.

Abstract. Try to keep this section in one paragraph. It should not be an in depth analysis.

Objective. What problem does the project solve? This does not need to be a long section.

Deliverables. What will the project consist of when it is finished? Source code, documentation, a build system, libraries, binaries. These should all be enumerated and described in details in your proposal.

Timeline. When will the deliverables be done? This section needs to be chronologically and technically detailed.

Biography. Tell us about yourself.

We highly recommend having some initial discussion with one of the mentors about your proposal before you submit it.

### Description

GNSS-SDR is an open source Global Navigation Satellite Systems software receiver, written in C++, that is able to work either from raw signal samples stored in a file, or in real-time with a radio-frequency front-end as signal source, and performs all the signal processing until the observable computation and Position-Velocity-Time solution. Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.
The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: If you are an eligible and interested student, read through the list and note the projects you are interested in. Then submit a proposal to Google, using the GSoC 2017 website. We recommend you to submit your application early. By doing so, it will be given a greater share of attention than is possible for applications submitted at the last minute.
You might submit a proposal following the guidelines below, or you might want to adapt it. Changes to the proposal could include:
+ You think the project as suggested is too large and you can only feasibly complete part of it; if so, make sure your proposal covers a reasonable subset of the functionality.
+ You think the project as suggested is too small; in this case you might want to extend the idea, combine projects, etc.
+ You like the basic idea of the project but it is not such a good fit for the skills that you have; in this case please feel free to suggest an alternative.

Your proposal should include the following: your project proposal, why you would like to execute on this particular project, and the reason you are the best individual to do so. Your proposal should also include details of your academic, industry, and/or open source development experience, and other details as you see fit. An explanation of your development methodology and schedule is a good idea, as well. It is always helpful to include your contact information, as it will not be automatically shared with your would-be mentors as part of the proposal process.

### Description

GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.

Octave is continually being upgraded. The current version 4.2 includes a graphical user interface, support for classdef object-oriented programming, and many new and improved functions. Student projects may also involve developing or upgrading Octave Forge packages, which can be loaded to provide additional specialized functions that supplement those provided in Core Octave.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Post on our [mailing list](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/octave-maintainers) or chat on [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#octave) to get feedback on your ideas, and help with any questions.

### Description

GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.

In brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!

You can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.

GNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.

### Application Instructions

### Description

HAIKU is an open source operating system currently in development. Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.

What’s so good about Haiku anyway?
==

The key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:

Specific focus on personal computing
Custom kernel designed for responsiveness
Fully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs
Rich object-oriented API for faster development
Database-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata
Unified, cohesive interface

Why Haiku?
==

The Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.

Who is behind Haiku?
==

Haiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.

### Description

Haskell is an advanced, general-purpose, purely functional programming language.  It has a strong, static type system with Hindley-Milner type inference.

The language natively supports lazy evaluation, and functions are generally not allowed to have side effects. This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By not allowing side effects and dealing with immutable data, the compiler can avoid whole classes of bugs.

Haskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.

In Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):

- Compilers
- Commonly used libraries
- Commonly used applications written in Haskell
- Profilers, debuggers and other tools
- Package managers and infrastructure

We have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: We have a [list of project ideas](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html).

In this list, prominent members of the Haskell community have suggested projects they care to address and fit well (time- and subject-wise) within the scope of the Google Summer of Code.  The current authors of this list range from university professors (e.g., Eisenberg) to advanced ghc developers (e.g., Gamari). Yet, contributions to the project ideas list is still open, inviting students to propose variations of the current ideas or a completely new project. The Haskell.org community is welcoming and happy to discuss these ideas with prospective students, via IRC or our mailing lists.

Each project is labeled with its difficulty level, ranging from "Beginner", targeting newcomers, to "Advanced", better fitted for students who already have experience with Haskell. The exact prerequisites differ from project to project, thus it is suggested for students to contact their prospective mentor before submitting an application.

From our side, when evaluating the student applications it is crucial that the applicant understands the problem and knows how to tackle it. Students should break down the project into smaller problems, assigning difficulty and time estimates to those sub-problems and explain how these sub-problems fit in the bigger picture of the project.

We also suggest adding some more information about the student's experience and education (if any), even if this relates to another programming language or technology.

### Description

__Description of the code__
[SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:
- soft and rigid body dynamics,
- heat transfer,
- robotics
- and visualization.

![Modeling with SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SectionLiver-s.png)

__1. Coupling SOFA + Pulse__
The objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library [Pulse](http://physiology.kitware.com/) platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.

__2. Emscriptening Sofa__
We now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly. 

__3. Communication protocols in SOFA__
The purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA.

### Description

The Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IAI) at the University of Bremen, Germany, headed by Prof. Michael Beetz, investigates methods for cognition-enabled robot control. The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: **Please read the up to date instructions from our [application page](http://ai.uni-bremen.de/teaching/gsoc2018)**. Every project will have a small test/tutorial that have to be fulfilled in order to consider the application of the student. We do this in order to avoid copy-paste applications from students. The tutorials/tests are relatively simple and only require students proof that they managed to install and the required software and write a possible 'Hello World' code snippet.

### Description

# What is InterMine?
InterMine integrates data from different biological sources, providing a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our [client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript](http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries).
## What technologies do we use? 
InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.
## What sort of data does InterMine have? 
Since InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a "data sources" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates. 
## What kind of problems does InterMine solve?
Genomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? 
One way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? 
Code you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Hello, and thank you for considering InterMine as your mentor organisation for Google Summer of Code! Please visit our [GSoC project ideas page](http://intermine.org/gsoc/project-ideas/2018/) and browse through the ideas. If one of them looks like it might interest you, contact the mentors directly to express your interest and discuss the projects further. 

## A few tips 
- Send us your CV / resume and tell us why you think you'd be a good choice for this project. 
- Now's the time to tell us what you can do! If you've written code, share it with us. A uni coding assignment is a good example of your work even if you don't have anything else. 
- Try to upload your code to GitHub (or a similar repository) if you can. Remember that if it's easy for us to examine and run, we're more likely to be interested than if all we receive is a zip file with no instructions. 
- A little-known secret: Open source code isn't only about the code. We'd also like to see evidence of your communication, project management, and documentation skills.
- Biology knowledge is a bonus but is definitely not required. 
- Please visit our [GSoC site](http://intermine.org/gsoc/guidance/students-applying/) for full guidance and application details.

## Custom ideas
If you're comfortable enough with InterMine's APIs (or data, or codebase) to propose your own project idea, we'd love to discuss it with you! Please drop an email to info@intermine.org to sound out your idea.

### Description

[ISC](https://www.isc.org/mission/) is the organization behind the ongoing development and distribution of the name server software, **BIND**. Our team of engineers helps drive the DNS standards and author the reference implementation that is then distributed as commercial-quality open source software for the Internet community. ISC provides the same leadership both in standards development and software for the DHCP protocol: **ISC DHCP** and **Kea**. Over the years, the ISC team has written over [60 RFCs](https://www.isc.org/community/rfcs/isc-rfcs/); we are proud of our substantial contributions to the [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://ietf.org).

Administrators adopting Kea are looking for new ways to manage their core network services. They are attracted by Kea's separation of lease data from network communications, that facilitates centralized provisioning. They want to leverage Kea's hooks api and REST api to integrate DHCP with other network operations. As the explosion of containerized applications is breaking the old 1:1 relationship of IP addresses to machines, they need more flexibility and automation for services like DNS updating. The Kea team are looking for contributors who want to help us bring this core network management service into the 21st century by improving and extending the monitoring, provisioning, extensibility and performance.

ISC is a non-profit company. Our open source software is freely available on our website and on [https://github.com/isc-projects](github). ISC work is supported by the sale of software support contracts, and by donations from users who want to see free open source maintained and extended for everyone.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please visit [Kea website](http://kea.isc.org), or the [ISC website](https://www.isc.org) for more information.

If you are interested, we recommend joining the [kea-dev mailing list](https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo/kea-dev) or at least reading the recent archives of that or [Kea-users](https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo/kea-users). Discuss your ideas with the developers on kea-dev, or you can email us privately at info@isc.org. 

To apply,  please look at the list of proposed projects at http://kea.isc.org/wiki/KeaIdeas.  If there is an idea that you are interested in proposing, the first step is to come up with some requirements and a proposed design. For examples, see some of the requirements and designs we have written for other Kea features (these larger and more complex than a typical summer project however): http://kea.isc.org/wiki/HARequirements, http://kea.isc.org/wiki/SharedSubnets, http://kea.isc.org/wiki/Commands. 

Technical Skills needed for success:
Kea implements the DHCP standards developed by the technical community in the IETF. General knowledge of DHCP, IPv6 and network operations in general are extremely helpful for these projects.  

Kea is written in C++11. The Kea project uses Google test, Google benchmarks, provides a REST interface and can use a number of DB backends: MySQL, Postgres, and Cassandra.  Experience with these technologies will give you a head start on the project. 

If you join this project, you will learn how to create professional-quality code: we do rigorous code reviews, require unit tests, written requirements and user and developer documentation.

Project categories range from better testing support over IDEs, application servers, application and performance monitoring to micro-services.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Before submitting you should talk to the potential mentor(s) who can give you more details about the idea and clarify questions about the idea that you (should) have.

In your proposal you need to present yourself and why you want to work on the idea. The proposal needs to include a detailed timeline that shows what you will implement when. Of course you need to sync up with your mentor on it. Very important is to exactly qualify what you want to have achieved by mid-term.

It will be good for you if you start interacting with the project community and looking at existing code even if it is an uncertain bet on the future. In the past we got a lot more submissions from students than slots for students, so students that have already interacted (well) with the community will be in a better position in the selection process.

Some projects may not want to accept students that did not interact with the potential mentors and the project before. It may even be required so solve a task before being considered.

### Description

JdeRobot is a software development framework for robotics and computer
vision applications. These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent
software. It is written in C++, Python and JavaScript, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE
communication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.

Real robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.

Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor
or the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.

JdeRobot include many tools: (a) JdeRobot-Academy, a suite for teaching robotics and computer vision, with 20 motivating exercises; (b) VisualStates, for visual creation of automata that control robot behavior; (c) Scratch2JdeRobot, for programming advanced robots with a full visual language; (d) robot teleoperators, even with web technologies; (e) a tuner for color filters, etc.

# Why JGraphT?

JGraphT has served as the de facto standard Java graph data structure and algorithm library for more than a decade, and its activity levels and popularity have continued to grow over the years.  But graph theory is a fertile and expansive field, so there's always more to do!  By contributing to JGraphT, you'll be powering the projects of many academic researchers and industry developers now and in the future, and gaining real-world development experience for yourself.

# What's Involved

Most of the projects on our ideas list are algorithm implementations or improvements.  After ramping up on general familiarity with JGraphT, carrying out a project typically involves 

* reading relevant research papers
* studying existing portions of our codebase
* discussing approaches with mentors and the rest of the community
* developing and testing an implementation in your own github branch
* submitting a pull request for review
* responding to code review comments
* over and over until...
* your pull request gets merged into trunk and eventually released!
* and then you get your first bug report :)

For larger projects, the work may need to be broken up into a series of pull requests.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: To apply, a student is asked to provide the following documents:
1.  CV, including:
    *  educational background
    *   relevant working experience

### Description

Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.

Jitsi Desktop (previously SIP Communicator) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP,  Bonjour, etc. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, macOS, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. 
The Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects such as 
ice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)
libjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)
Jitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)
Jitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)
Together with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.
The development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.

### Description

The Joomla Community manages two major software projects, the Joomla Content Management System and the Joomla Framework.

* The Joomla! CMS is a PHP based application that powers about 3.2% of the web, 6.5% of all CMS based websites, as well as many intranets.
* The Joomla Framework is a PHP application framework used for building web and command line applications, and is the basis of the Joomla CMS.

Each of these projects has hundreds of contributors, a set of working groups and teams, and a leadership group. These are coordinated by the [Production Department](https://volunteers.joomla.org/departments/production/ "Joomla Production Department"). This is an umbrella application for the two projects.

The Joomla CMS and Joomla Framework are community driven FOSS projects developed and maintained by an international community encompassing over 200 countries. Joomla is used by millions of websites and web applications ranging from the hobbyist, professional web developer, to large enterprises, for both the World Wide Web and intranets.

The Joomla Project is a community effort which strives to engage contributors from diverse backgrounds and varying interests and skills in building and supporting great software together. The [mission, vision and values](https://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/mission-vision-and-values.html "Joomla Mission vision and values") of the Joomla Project reflect this. 

The official sponsoring organisation is Open Source Matters (OSM), the not for profit organization that manages financial and legal issues for the Joomla Project. A team of experienced people drawn from many areas of the project will manage the 2018 GSoC project for Joomla.

### Description

Kiwix brings internet content to people without internet access. Based on the openZIM file format, a website -any website- will be converted to a .zim file that can be then stored locally and accessed without the need for a further internet connexion: users can then access Wikipedia, the Wiktionary, TED talks, the Gutenberg library on their device, wherever they are and whenever they please. Kiwix runs on most platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux) and is, of course, free to use.

The software passed the million direct downloads mark at the end of 2016, 80% of these users being in the Global South. Kiwix is also used by a host of organizations around the world, be it in rural schools of Western and Southern Africa or education and rehabilitation programs in US and European prisons. There are also uses we hadn't planned for: Kiwix is for instance [distributed by the Cuban government](https://www.ecured.cu/EcuMóvil) to help people save on data costs, or by NGOs in North Korea trying to [smuggle uncensored information](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/north-korea/) into the hermit kingdom. 

We have recently started releasing "custom apps"; that is, Android apps that are based on the Kiwix engine but offer only a specific piece of content. A good example is WikiMed, an application that offers medical content from Wikipedia in 10 languages: again, it is particularly popular in the Global South (India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Iraq and Egypt, but to name a few of our larger user bases).

### Description

# The Lua Language

Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description. Since its creation, in 1993, Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds), and is currently the leading scripting language in games.

# The Céu Language
Céu is a Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming language that aims to offer a higher-level and safer alternative to C. It extends classical structured programming with two main functionalities: event handling and synchronous, deterministic concurrency. 

#LabLua
LabLua is a research laboratory at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), affiliated with its Computer Science Department. It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua and Céu languages. LabLua was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.

## Getting in touch

You are encouraged to contact us before submitting your application. Getting in touch first is especially recommended if you are planning to apply to work on an original idea, rather than one of our suggestions. To introduce yourself, discuss ideas or your application, feel free to join us at our lab's GSoC mailing list. Our mentors will make sure to establish a friendly and respectful channel of communication with you.

## Am I experienced enough?

Check out the difficulty level on each proposed project. All projects are designed to fit the length of GSoC, given the student's suitable level of experience: a project marked Easy may be taken by an early-stage undergraduate, while a project marked Hard might be more appropriate for a graduate student, or a particularly experienced undergraduate. We will take this into consideration when matching students to projects.

### Description

### What

LanguageTool scans texts for style, spelling, and grammar errors. In some cases, it can even find semantic issues. For example, what could be wrong about "Thursday, 27 June 2017"? Well, 27 June 2017 was not on a Thursday, and LanguageTool detects that.

LanguageTool supports more than 20 languages (to a different degree), including English, Russian, German, Polish, Spanish, and French.

### How

Internally, LanguageTool uses four different approaches to find errors:
* it scans for known error pattern with a pattern languages similar to regular expressions, but more powerful
* it uses Java code to find errors that are too complex for the error-pattern approach
* it uses statistics to find uncommon sequences of words
* it uses artificial intelligence to see if commonly confused words are used properly (like ad/add or cease/seize)

### The Future

Artificial intelligence will be the main approach in the future to detect text errors. We're looking for your help and ideas to apply AI to the proofreading problem, for example by using a seq2seq approach like in machine translation.

LanguageTool is also an end user application, and users want LanguageTool to be integrated in the software they already use. We're looking for integrations into tinyMCE, CKEditor, and many others (your suggestions are welcome). Plus, the existing browser add-on for Firefox and Chrome needs major UI improvements.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Requirements depend on what part of LanguageTool you'd like to work on:

**User interface / browser add-on**
* requires knowledge of Javascript and web technologies

**Core logic of error detection, using AI**
* requires knowledge of at least one machine learning framework
* requires enough Java knowledge to integrate the results (not necessarily the training) into our existing Java code

**Core logic of error detection**
* requires good knowledge of Java and being a native speaker of the language you're going to improve the error detection for

In any case, we expect you to have a close look at our ideas list at http://wiki.languagetool.org/missing-features and check out the existing code at https://github.com/languagetool-org/. Once you have a better idea of what you'd like to do, please contact us at https://forum.languagetool.org to introduce yourself. We'll try to find a small task for you get started. Or even better, you fix one of the existing bugs and submit a pull request.

### Description

LEAP is a dedicated to giving all internet users access to secure communication. Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.

On the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.

The LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.

First of all, have a look at the project's ideas page. Come talk to as at IRC: #leap (at freenode) if you need advice for your proposal.

One important piece of advice is: be very honest about what your skills and motivations are. You don't need to be an uber-hacker to contribute something small and beautiful to the project: after all, it's more about the journey than arriving there in a rush.

That said, we hope than we can have great fun together, and get some nice lines of code written!

some tips
========

* have a look at the example projects in the project's ideas page, there are ideas for a great diversity of skills and difficulties.
* we prefer projects that are completely isolated from the main codebase.
* we prefer things that start small and can grow afterwards. go for a soledad-based hello-world app in a new language (golang? rust?) if you feel excited about the idea. the important thing is to get started, completion and correctness can be added later.
* if you think you have a good idea and it's not in the list, don't be shy and tell us about it.
* don't hesitate to make lots of questions to us before sending your proposal.
* not everything is code: tell us a bit about yourself and what are your motivations.

### Description

LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.

LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.

We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.

Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.

The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: First, please present yourself. Since we don't know you we want to know some bits like your name, education, email address and nickname on the #libreoffice-dev IRC channel at freenode.net. Please subscribe to the [LibreOffice developer list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/libreoffice) and write an email to the list.

We will require students to complete one of the easy programming tasks on the ["Easy Hacks" page](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/EasyHacks) (or part of one if that EasyHack is a selection of separate tasks), though the dead-line for this isn't hard but needs to be somewhere before the end of the selection process. This means that each student who wants to have chances to be picked for a LibreOffice project will need to build the whole application, fix a bug and submit the patch to the development mailing list.

Explain what you want to achieve. Provide detailed informations on the project you want to work on and the use cases. The more precise your description is, the more it will show us that you investigated the area and though about it properly before submitting. The best is to base your project on one of our Ideas that come complete with friendly mentors to help you. You may have some nice project ideas, but make sure that someone will be able to mentor your project and knows that part of the code well enough.

Problems that can not be resolved on our public developer mailing list or problems containing privacy relevant topics can also be sent to our [mentoring@documentfoundation.org](mailto:mentoring@documentfoundation.org) address.

### Description

The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.

The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:
*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").
*  Clang is an "LLVM native" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.
*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.
*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.
*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.
*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.

In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: We strongly suggest each proposal to be discussed first at the corresponding sub-project mailing list (e.g. llvm-dev, cfe-dev, etc.) Prior patch submission to LLVM (or its subprojects) is recommended, but not strictly required. Please also indicate your prior knowledge with LLVM, whether you already contributed to it, etc.

### Description

# Why LuaRocks?

Lua is a tiny yet powerful programming language, a tiny yet powerful language used anywhere from embedded systems, to AI, to networking, to MMORPGs. The secret to its success is its _embeddability_: Lua is a tiny portable core than can be adapted to any project.

The flip-side to this is that Lua itself does not come with many libraries, it features only the bare minimum. Enter LuaRocks: by using it to  install additional packages called "rocks", LuaRocks turbo-charges Lua, making it a suitable language for any field.

# The package repository

In the [luarocks.org](http://luarocks.org) repository one can find packages for all sorts of areas. LuaRocks also allows third-party projects to host their own package repositories (either in [luarocks.org](http://luarocks.org) or in their own servers), so that LuaRocks can work as the plugin manager to their project.

# The build system

LuaRocks also doubles as a portable build system for compiling Lua modules. It abstracts away platform differences and allows module developers using Lua or C to distribute Lua extensions that can build in any modern operating system.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Thank you for your interest in LuaRocks! 

To apply as a student for GSoC, follow these steps:

### Description

MariaDB Server began as a database server that offers drop-in replacement functionality to MySQL and has grown into being a default "MySQL" in many Linux distributions. MariaDB Server is built by some of the original authors of MySQL, with assistance from the broader community of free and open source software developers. In addition to the core functionality of MySQL, MariaDB Server offers a rich set of feature enhancements including alternate storage engines, advanced server optimizations, and other features. MariaDB Server is feature enhanced, community developed and backward compatible with MySQL. MariaDB Server ships in all major Linux distributions and is backed by the MariaDB Foundation.

MariaDB offers a fully synchronous replication solution, MariaDB Galera Cluster, an intelligent proxy called MariaDB MaxScale, and a data analytics solution MariaDB ColumnStore. MariaDB Server also has LGPL client libraries for C, Java and ODBC.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Consider starting from [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) or [GSoC Student Manual](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide). Join #maria channel on Freenode and maria-developers@lists.launchpad.net.
Your proposal should contain at least those parts:
* _Who are you?_ Tell something about yourself, like your name, education, email address and irc nickname, GitHub profile, your contributions to Open Source projects, and so on.
* _What do you want to do?_ Describe the project, as you'd do it to a user. Changes in behavior, new SQL commands, etc. Do not talk about function names, algorithms or data structures here.
* _How do you want to do it?_ Here you should describe your project in term of internals, function names, algorithms and data structures. What do you want to change and how. Try to show that you know what you're talking about and not simply copied from the project ideas page.
* _When do you plan to do what?_ Present the timeline here. What will be ready when? Structure your work so that you could test new code immediately, implement your project in small steps that could be tested incrementally. Reserve at least 40% of the time for testing.
Note, you will almost certainly write a better proposal and will improve your chance of being accepted if you'll discuss your project first on the mailing list or the irc.
After you've filed the proposal, you might receive a reply from a mentor with a test assignment. It will be a small task related to MariaDB code base that will allow you to prove your abilities in C/C++ and setting up a development environment

### Description

### What is Matrix?
Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.

[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.

### What is Matrix’s Mission?
Matrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.

The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.

### What does this mean for users?
The aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.

### How is Matrix currently being used?
[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to existing services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with Gitter or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!

Recent work on Matrix includes [E2E encryption](https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/) (see FOSDEM 2017 talks below), [embeddable widgets](https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/23/introducing-matrix-widgets/), [Communities](https://medium.com/@RiotChat/communities-aka-groups-are-here-announcing-riot-web-0-13-riot-ios-0-6-and-riot-android-0-7-4-933cb193a28e) and [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)!

* [The future of decentralised communication](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/matrix_future/)

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: In order to apply to Matrix, students should first get to know the project and community by browsing [the Matrix Specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec) and launching a Matrix client and joining the [#gsoc:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#gsoc:matrix.org) chatroom.  Students may also wish to hang out in #matrix:matrix.org or #matrix-dev:matrix.org to better understand the project.

A good next starting point is to play with the Matrix API to send and perhaps receive some instant messages - or experiment with some of the more unusual Matrix clients which are currently in development.  Another good bet would be to try installing a Matrix homeserver (e.g. https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) to get a feeling for the technology involved.

We then suggest thoroughly reading through our [GSoC Ideas List](https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/IDEAS.md) and asking questions on #gsoc:matrix.org about the items which interest you.  The ideas are intended for inspiration - almost all of our GSoC projects to date have been influenced but not dictated by the ideas list. **Please note that the final 6 items on the list are included primarily as 'food for thought'**.  Having run your ideas past the chatroom for feedback, we recommend writing a 3-5 page proposal in Google Docs to flesh it out more fully.  You are welcome to ask the team for guidance on the proposal as you write it.

For more details on how to write the proposal itself, please see https://github.com/matrix-org/GSoC/blob/master/README.md.

Our data is mostly gathered by volunteers and verified by peer review to ensure it is consistent and correct. All non-commercial use of this data is free, but commercial users are asked to support us in order to help fund the project. We encourage all data users to contribute to the data gathering process so that our data can be as comprehensive as possible.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: We require very detailed proposals and we insist that you work with our community to improve your application. Tell us everything about your proposed project. Include diagrams to help us understand your proposal. If you propose anything that requires a database schema you need to show us the proposed schema. The same applies to UI changes/additions -- we need to see mock-ups. If you provide no mock-ups, schemas or supporting diagrams, you won't be accepted.

As part of applying for SoC we require that you take your idea and propose it to the MusicBrainz developer community. Please propose the idea and then respond to any  questions that may arise. Improve your proposal based on the feedback you receive from the community. If you cannot  get the community to support your idea your chances for getting your proposal accepted are very slim. Finally, in order to have your GSoC application be accepted by MetaBrainz you MUST interact with your potential mentor and submit one bug fix or new feature that is related to your proposal. You will need to create a schedule of how you plan to spend your time. A weekly breakdown with a few milestones is best.

Do you have Github , Twitter or any other public profiles you think we might find interesting?
Have you contributed to other Open Source projects or created projects on your own time? If so, which projects and can we see some of your code?
Do you plan to have a job or study during the summer in conjunction with Summer of Code?

### Description

The Metasploit Framework is both a penetration testing system and a development platform for creating security tools and exploits. The framework is used by network security professionals to perform penetration tests, system administrators to verify patch installations, product vendors to perform regression testing, and security researchers world-wide. The framework is written in the Ruby programming language and includes components written in C, many flavors of Assembly, Python, Powershell, PHP, and other languages.

The framework consists of tools, libraries, modules, and user interfaces. The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.

### Description

mlpack is a C++ machine learning library with emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease-of-use. Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users. This is done by providing a set of command-line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C++ API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.

As a result of this approach, mlpack outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins; the handful of publications relating to mlpack demonstrate this.

mlpack is developed by contributors from around the world. It is released free of charge, under the 3-clause BSD License. (Versions older than 1.0.12 were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License: LGPL, version 3.)

mlpack bindings for R are provided by the RcppMLPACK project.

### Description

# Why Terasology

We set out to see how an open source and super extensible voxel game inspired by Minecraft could go beyond it and offer gameplay like seen in Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper. What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?

# Minimal Engine

Our engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.

# Extensibility

Any content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.

Creating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: The keys to successful proposals are: creativity, professionalism and effort.

We want to be inspired by your proposal and we appreciate that you put reasonable effort in it and generate a reasonably professional output. 

We expect a proposal that is about 3 pages long. 

The description of the project should make the bulk of the proposal and it should go in some detail. You are free to propose an entirely original project or to pick ideas from our GSOC page: 

https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/GSOC 

The proposal should also include rough weekly goals and broader milestone goals coinciding with the three evaluation phases. We expect inline documentation and javadocs throughout the project, but please notice that wrapping things up and adding "the final touches" at the end of the project takes time.

Finally, the proposal should include details about your experience/interests in relation to the GSOC project, but we'd prefer if you didn't include details such as photos, gender, age and other personal details that have no relevance to the project. Full resumes are also not useful.

Expect to stay in daily contact with the project during the work period. Such high visibility helps before too.

For some further ideas you can search the web for past GSOC proposals and/or check out the following two blog posts from one of our mentors:

### Description

The [National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)](http://www.nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery. Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. 

The NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/), [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/), and [cBioPortal](http://cbioportal.org/). *This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!* For example, Cytoscape is downloaded **16,000 times per month** by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our [>90% success rate](http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students [students](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and [mentors](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).

### Description

Data collection is a key component of social good efforts ranging from polio elimination to rainforest conservation and Open Data Kit (ODK) helps thousands of organizations collect data quickly, accurately, offline, and at scale. Users of ODK software include Red Cross, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control, Jane Goodall Institute, Gates Foundation, the Carter Center, and many others.

The ODK ecosystem has several tools that are used to collect data. For GSoC, we will focus on the popular Android form filling client ([ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect)), the desktop downloader ([ODK Briefcase](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase)), and a Android-based data collection hub ([ODK Services](https://github.com/opendatakit/services)).

** Examples of ODK projects are below. Contribute and make the world a better place! **

* Hutan Aceh in Indonesia is home to tigers, elephants, orangutans, and rhinos. EIA International and local activists protect it by documenting forest crimes with ODK. The geo-tagged forms, rich with photos, provide the evidence needed to save habitat. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/109241884).
* Evaluating global health programs involves collecting, organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data. Population Council, Marie Stopes Uganda, and Gobee Group use ODK to streamline the process. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/38123850).
* The Jane Goodall Institute uses ODK to empower local communities to better manage and monitor their forests. ODK lets these communities connect directly with the global carbon marketplace and demonstrate the concrete benefits of their efforts to protect the forest. [Watch video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CNXv8EEs0P8). 
* The Carter Center uses ODK to get the real-time data needed to assess elections. Over the last six years, ODK has been used to monitor elections in Liberia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Nepal, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, and Tunisia. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-CGzo3m4PA).
* For governments working to end polio, access to accurate and timely information makes a world of difference. ODK is used in Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and South Sudan as a key tool in mass polio vaccination campaign quality control. [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zROyvrvt-zk).

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Before completing your application, please complete a small feature or bug fix for the tool your proposal relates to ([ODK Collect](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect), [ODK Briefcase](https://github.com/opendatakit/briefcase), [ODK Services](https://github.com/opendatakit/services)). You may want to start by looking at the “quick win” and “contributor friendly” labels in the issue trackers. Be sure to include your GitHub username in your proposal.

We also highly encourage you to introduce yourself and to discuss your project idea in the #internships channel on our [Slack](http://slack.opendatakit.org). Please do not contact project mentors directly. For the benefit of the community, it's important that we have conversations out in the open!

### Description

### Introduction
The Roberta Initiative “Learning with Robots” was started more than 15 years ago by Fraunhofer IAIS in Germany with the objective to get kids interested in technology and science by constructing and programming robotic kits. The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.

### The lab
The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to programming robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <https://lab.open-roberta.org/> is online and has had more than 100.000+ visits in 2017 across 135 countries.

The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the form of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 7 different robot plugins:
* EV3 LEGO Mindstorms 
* NXT LEGO Mindstorms
* BBC micro:bit 
* Calliope mini
* Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based
* NAO, a humanoide robot
* Bob3

### Outlook
While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Before you apply, please have a look at what we have already developed. Play around with our [lab](https://lab.open-roberta.org), fork the robertalab repository, try to install and run it locally. Feel free to ask us for help, if necessary.

If you have already committed to an Open Source project, please provide a link to this in your application. If you haven't, no problem, but maybe you can provide us some other samples of your programming experience. Also student's projects are welcome.

Have a look at our list of proposals for GSOC. If you have another good idea, don't hesitate to come up with your own project proposal. Maybe you would like to discuss it with us before you apply, please use our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-roberta).

### Description

Open States is a project that makes it possible for people to track and engage with what is happening in their state's capitol.

Via a system of custom crawlers for each state legislature, we collect information on state governments: bills, votes, committees, events, and legislators. This information allows journalists, academics, activists, and concerned citizens track what is happening in their state, and engage with their elected officials.

This information is then made available via OpenStates.org, the Open States API, and bulk downloads. The site and data are used by journalists, activists, academics, and everyday citizens interested in keeping track of their elected officials.

Originally a project of the Sunlight Foundation, Open States became an independent project in late 2016 and is now under the 501(c)(3) umbrella of the Open Media Foundation.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: When applying please be sure to include your GitHub and Slack handle, hopefully you will have engaged with us in both locations by the time we're reviewing your application so we'd like to be sure we connect your real name to your handle.

Here's what we're looking for:

- You come to us with a well-defined task that will improve Open States (see ideas section below).
- Your idea seems achievable within the 3 month GSoC period (May-August).
Note: If your idea is too big but you would like to work on it beyond the end of the GSoC period feel free to figure out a concrete portion to propose for the summer and elaborate on how you'd potentially continue it afterwards. We're glad to discuss options.
- Show us who you are and why you're well-suited to work with us. GitHub profiles are great, a PR or two would also be terrific. Or jump on our Slack and introduce yourself.
- Please include a rough schedule of what you'd expect to do in the first, second, and third months.
- Commit to a once-a-week minimum check-in with your mentor. Vacations, etc. are fine but we'll want to meet as often as possible to ensure success.

### Description

OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects that are used by researchers and engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the [Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.nasa.gov/hubble), the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg. [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft (eg. [HORIZONS](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi)). The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.

OpenAstronomy is currently formed by [12 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: 
- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; 
- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;
- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.
- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;
- And [more](http://openastronomy.org/members/)!

As a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our "sister" projects.

### Application Instructions

### Description

Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.

### Description

OpenStreetMap is a project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. The data is collected by volunteers around the globe largely from scratch and released with an open-content license. We allow free access to our map images and all of its underlying map data. We aim to promote new and interesting uses of our data which makes the project's uses, and the possible Google Summer of Code projects, very diverse.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: We have had good experiences with students who introduced themselves to our community and their respective mentor in advance. It helps to get the student and mentor know to each other, to know if they can work together and to elaborate on the details expected for a specific project. This also improves the timeline that has to be provided by our students. Depending on the project or mentor, we might request a software prototype or to solve a small exercise to estimate the student's experience level and their ambition to work with us. For the application itself we will publish a template on our wiki page to help the student submit a good application with everything that's needed from our side. More details are published [here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2018#Project_Proposal).

### Description

The openSUSE project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux everywhere. openSUSE creates two of the world's best Linux distributions, working together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the worldwide Free and Open Source Software community.

The project is controlled by its community and relies on the contributions of individuals, working as testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists and ambassadors or developers. The project embraces a wide variety of technology, people with different levels of expertise, speaking different languages and having different cultural backgrounds.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Contact the mentor early to get to know his expectations is the most important task before start writing your proposal. All our projects have issues labeled as **good first issue** / **junior job**. We recommend you to make at least one contribution to the project as that will help you to find out if this is the right project for you and to write a proposal, but you do **not** need to send a lot pull requests. The decision to select a student is made based on the proposal and not in the number of previous contributions. Remember that quality is more important than quantity!

**Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.

**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.

**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.

**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits.

**About me:** Write a few lines about you.

### Description

In the summer of 2008 the [Metropolitan City of Rome](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/) decided to start a **free of charge and public Wi-Fi network** to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.

From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. 

The methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.
 The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.

### Description

# Why Oppia?
Oppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala

# Interactive learning
Oppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.

A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. 

# Community-driven lesson creation
The other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.

# Come join us!
Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: # Applying to Oppia
Please take a look at our dedicated GSoC 2018 wiki page [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018) for information about project ideas, what we’re looking for in a proposal, a proposal template, and how to apply to our organization. We also strongly recommend taking a look at our [developer wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki) in order to become familiar with our development process.

Please note that most Oppia work heavily involves AngularJS for frontend development, and Google App Engine with Python 2.7 for backend development. You will also need a GitHub account.

### Description

# Why PEcAn? #
Climate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.


 # How does PEcAn do that? #

PEcAn consists of **1)** state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, **2)** a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and **3)** a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. 

# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # 

PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.

# High functionality and performance #

In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: 1. Choose a project from our [project ideas list](http://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html) or come up with your own.

2. Fill out the [PEcAn GSoC application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCwaVPiqhasHGZY3GnAuJOKHxqF1t53g3ZdITduzK-jBQFAg/viewform?usp=sf_link). The form is pretty self-explanatory, and it requires completing a project specific technical task which will in return help you write your proposal.
*Please fill out the form in a timely manner so that we can review it sooner and give you feedback.*

3. Send an email to your project-specific mentors indicating that you have completed the form, attach your resume or CV, and request feedback.

4. With guidance from your mentors, write your proposal.

5. Start coding!

### Description

The Performance Co-Pilot is a toolkit designed for monitoring and managing system-level performance.  These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.

PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:

###### PCP Collectors
These are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.

###### PCP Monitors
These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.

The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.

Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please read through the potential projects on the [Ideas page] (http://pcp.io/gsoc/2018/ideas.html) for the Performance Co-Pilot organisation.

Each project has an associated level of difficulty, prerequisite knowledge and mentors.  You are encouraged to contact individual mentors to seek clarification or further detail about individual projects that are of interest to you before you apply.

The mentors are experts in their fields who are volunteering time to help you.  Make the most of them - they are wonderfully kind and friendly people who want you to learn and succeed!

There is scope for extending or changing the projects somewhat to suit your goals.  Once you have decided on a general area, using one of the Ideas as a starting point, please put together a project proposal and send it to <pcp-mentors@groups.io>.  The proposal must outline your understanding of the topic, and provide a detailed description of what you aim to achieve.  It should also contain a short bio about yourself, your background and current skills.

Happy hacking!

### Description

## What is phpBB?
phpBB ('BB' for Bulletin Board) is the world's most popular free and open-source forum solution. Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain while also being fun and simple to use.

## Why choose phpBB?
Originally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include an extensive permissions system, user groups,  hierarchical subforums, file attachments, intuitive notifications, OAuth authentication, support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), and a variety of other features. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.

Our strict security practices have resulted in a hardened product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.

## phpBB and Google Summer of Code
We are proud to have participated in the GSoC program during four prior years. The goal of our mentors is to ensure that all students have a smooth and fulfilling experience. Former phpBB GSoC students have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team. We hope that you will help us continue this excellent trend.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: ## Get in touch
We'd like to get to know you as soon as possible! Join us on IRC and introduce yourself. Don't wait until the last moment to ask questions and meet your prospective mentor.

## Requirements
We require all students to successfully contribute one small patch (>10 lines of scripting code) prior to having their proposal selected. We're here to assist and happy to walk you through the process.

## Proposal writing tips
These are suggestions based on what we have seen work in the past. Of course, there could be many reasons why they do not apply to your particular case, and that is perfectly okay. You can always ask us for help if you have any doubts.

We have found that good proposals are generally 1-4 pages long, and contains the following sections:

**Introduction**: A few lines about you, your studies, and your qualifications to implement the specific idea. 

**Features and design**: This is the most important part of your proposal. You should outline what you would like to implement, and how it integrates with the phpBB software. You do not need to specify all implementation details, however (e.g.: if you need some data that is expensive to generate, it is important that you mention the need to cache the sorted data, however you don't need to specify the sorting mechanism).

**Timeline**: Your project should be broken down into tasks with specific milestones. We generally like timelines broken down by individual weeks. 

If in doubt, just ask us. We're excited to be working with you!

### Description

PMD is a static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.

# Programming Languages
Initially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 8 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.

# Copy-Paste-Detector
Additionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in all the above languages and additionally in C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, and Swift.

# Usage
PMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.

# Extensibility
PMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.

An innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Although PMD is a mature project there are plenty of opportunities to improve and build upon existing features.
We've collected already many ideas in our [Wiki](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/%5BGSoC%5D-Google-Summer-of-Code).

We have two kinds of idea lists:

* [Project Ideas [Mature]](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Project-Ideas-%5BMature%5D) are ready to use ideas that can be tackled immediately.
* [Project Ideas [Inception]](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Project-Ideas-%5BInception%5D) are ideas, that need some additional effort to properly define goals. There is even the [Roadmap](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/wiki/Roadmap-and-future-directions) with more topics.

You may also suggest a project of your own or take an idea and adjust it. Please make sure to discuss it with us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/pmd/pmd), on our [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pmd-devel) or [issue tracker](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues) beforehand.

### Description

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.

An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate. There are active PostgreSQL instances in production environments that manage many terabytes of data, as well as clusters managing petabytes. Some general PostgreSQL limits are included in the table below.

### Description

# What is a GitHub App?

A GitHub app is an application that receives request each time something happens in repositories that they are installed on and can then act as a bot user to make changes.

A very simple example is the [WIP GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/wip) – it sets the status of a pull request to pending if the word "wip" is in the pull request subject. The status gets updated each time the pull request title is changed.

# How does Probot work?

Probot is a Node.js framework based on the [Express Server framework](http://expressjs.com/). It provides APIs to subscribe to events that are happening on GitHub to run your custom code. For example, the `WIP GitHub App` mentioned above is built with Probot in only about 20 lines of code: https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master

# Why apply for Probot?

You will create your very own GitHub application, your own product that you can add to your portfolio at the end of the summer. While working on your own app, you will interact with the Probot core team and learn how to contribute to the core project itself.

We look forward to meeting you :)

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Pick an existing idea at https://github.com/probot/ideas/issues or suggest a new idea for a Probot application that you would like to work on. Familiarize yourself with the project before applying. You should have worked with Node.js before, but don’t need to be an expert. We encourage applications by students from groups underrepresented in tech :)

### Description

## Measuring pollution at low cost

Public Lab is focused on democratizing the tools and techniques of environmental science so that communities who face pollution and other environmental problems can actually use them.

We believe that low cost, open source, easy to use hardware and software can enable anyone to collect data with which to hold polluters accountable.

## Sensor data and open hardware development

Public Lab software projects focus on two areas: community collaboration and open hardware development (PublicLab.org), and data processing for our sensors and tools (MapKnitter.org and SpectralWorkbench.org, among others).

Our collaboration and development platform PublicLab.org enables thousands of people to publish updates and share designs for emerging environmental open hardware projects. Our browser-based data analysis tools make use of HTML5 features such as CSS 3d transforms for image distortion and the WebRTC webcam API for capturing spectral data, to make advanced features available to users in a powerful cross-platform, user-friendly, database-backed approach to open science tools.

### Description

Purr data is a visual programming language built for low-latency, realtime DSP synthesis. In addition to core functionality for working with audio and 2d graphics, it ships with a large set of external libraries to handle video, 2D/3D graphics, sensors, input devices, and networking.

Purr data has a special emphasis on generating audio and/or video in real time, with low latency. Much of its design focuses on receiving, manipulating, and delivering high-quality audio signals.  Specifically, the software addresses the problem of doing this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like OSX, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.

Purr Data builds on code from several other software projects: Pure Data-- which is the audio and scripting engine, Pd-extended-- which is a now abandoned application that shipped Pure Data with lots of external libraries, and Pd-l2ork-- which added long-needed usability enhancements like infinite-undo and native state-saving mechanisms to Pure Data.

Purr Data uses a GUI based on the nw.js toolkit. This means the entire GUI is built using HTML5 technologies, and any of those-- including thousands of web frameworks, the Gamepad API, WebGL, etc.-- may be leveraged by users and developers.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Prerequisites: At least one of the following languages: C, C++, any of the HTML5 languages, Pd

Please complete the following steps to apply:

1. Give us a clear written proposal of your idea, or choose one of the currently listed ideas.
2. Give us an estimate of how you plan to approach the problem. What are the biggest challenges of your chosen idea? Can parts of the problem be solved in parallel? Is there an order to which some or all of the parts of the problem must be solved? Which parts require the most expertise? Can some parts be solved without much domain expertise? Etc.
3. Present a proposed timeline for your research project. What are the "mile markers" for implementing your idea?
4. Give us a link to code from a project you've previously contributed to-- a FLOSS project is preferable but not mandatory.
5. Use at least one cat metaphor or reference in your proposal.

### Description

Building Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.

### Description

# What is Quill.org?
Quill.org is an education technology nonprofit that helps over 750,000 learners around the world improve their writing and critical thinking skills through innovative technological approaches. We're grateful to have support from organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google.org, and AT&T Foundation.

# Improving Education with Innovative Technology
Quill was recently featured in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/40458272/this-machine-learning-powered-software-teaches-kids-to-be-better-writers) and the [Google Machine Learning blog](https://blog.google/topics/machine-learning/quillorg-better-writing-machine-learning/) for our work applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to helping learners become better writers and critical thinkers. We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers. 

Learners begin by completing a [diagnostic activity](https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic) that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even [special versions of the diagnostic](https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692) for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)

Quill has a variety of activity types, including [a real-time classroom lessons mode](https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons), [a sentence construction tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/connect), [a proofreading practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader) and [a grammar practice tool](https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar).

Each tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.

# What's Next?

Up until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.

### Description

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.

The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.

R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.

### Description

The radare project started in February of 2006 aiming to provide a free and simple command line interface for a hexadecimal editor supporting 64 bit offsets to search and recover data from hard-disks.

Since then, the project has grown, and its aim has changed to provide a complete framework for analyzing binaries with some basic *NIX concepts in mind, like everything is a file, small programs that interact with each other using stdin/out, and keep it simple.

Radare2 is a complete LGPL3 rewrite of the original project, which removes design issues of the first iteration, and makes it more modular and easier to script and maintain. It features a testsuite that aims to cover as many cases as possible in order to catch regressions.

Radare2 is composed of a hexadecimal editor at its core, with support for several architectures and binary formats. It features code analysis capabilities, scripting, data and code visualization through graphs and other means, a visual mode, easy unix integration, a binary diffing engine for code and data, a shellcode compiler, and much, much more!

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: It is a requirement that students who want to apply to the radare2 project for the Google Summer of Code 2018 should submit a small pull request accomplishing one of the [microtasks](http://radare.org/gsoc/2018/tasks.html) as part of their application. You can also choose any of the GitHub issues if they are big enough to be a qualification task, still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks.

Steps for the application process

  - Read Google's instructions for participating
  - Grab any project from the [list of ideas](http://radare.org/gsoc/2018/ideas.html) that you're interested in (or propose your own)
  - Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and [our template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDPGgr_D5tQuYLQi_gEGlkuQ-DlU8GH5kDBqZbVSC7I/edit?usp=sharing) and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you
  - Submit it using Google's web interface

How to fill in the application template

  - Keep it simple enough to fit on no more than a couple of pages. Despite the shortness of the sentences, try to preserve the clarity of the proposal.
  - Try to split the GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. 
 - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.
 - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.
 - Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute
 - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.

### Description

Red Hen Lab is a distributed consortium of researchers in multimodal communication, with participants all over the world. We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations, and also junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis. 

Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.

For GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please clearly state your proposal, whether it is a new project or an improvement to an existing system.  

Bear in mind that your project should result in a module that is installed on our high performance computing cluster, fully tested, with clear instructions, and ready to be deployed to process a massive data set.  The module should include a well documented API file that can be used by a wide variety of coders, especially those who come after you, and those who are not experts in your problem domain.

Your project should be scaled to the appropriate level of ambition, so that at the end of the summer you have a working product.  Be realistic and honest with yourself about what you think you will be able to accomplish in the course of the summer.  Provide a detailed list of the steps you believe are needed, the tools you propose to use, and a weekly schedule of deliverables.  Clear and proper documentation can take much longer than expected.

If you are proposing a machine learning project, base the proposal on techniques that have already been successful in other similar projects.  Include as much information about previous research and results as possible.  Accuracy measurements will be required, and they should be as automated as possible.

Please be prepared to follow code formatting standards closely and to work with Singularity (virtual Linux system) images throughout the summer.

### Description

RoboComp is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: These are the steps you should follow when working on your application:
1. Familiarize with the software,  download, and use RoboComp: https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/master/README.md.
2. Go through the tutorials and direct your questions to the mailing list or gitter chat (listed below, also see contact section):  https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/master/doc/README.md.
3. Please read all the information posted in the ideas page before applying.
4. Make sure you are familiar with the required skills for the idea. 
5. Mentors and backup mentors are listed right after the idea explanation. All mentors contact info is in the ideas page. Contact them directly for specific questions on the idea.

As a result you should provide the following material in your application to the correct mentor and the backup mentor for review:
* Schedule proposal of your work during summer of code with proper milestones. 
* Code examples that prove your suitable for the task (better if they are small improvements of RoboComp in the line of the idea you are applying).
* CV and other applications materials  you want to include.

NOTE: If you send this by email make sure to also submit your application through the official GSoC website otherwise you will not be considered for the programme.

### Description

Rocket.Chat is one of the largest active open source (permissive MIT source license) nodeJS communications platform communities on GitHub, featuring 600+ global community contributors (across projects) from 30+ countries, 15780+ GitHub stars, 3300 forks, 140+  total releases and 6,200+  issues since inception in 2015.

In a world where communication platforms are almost all totally proprietary, privacy-infringing, and centralized (Skype, Slack, WhatsApp, and so on). Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.

Our server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.

The server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a "modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.

Rocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.  

Chat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.

### Application Instructions

### Description

## Ruby on Rails make web application development easy and fun.

Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a "best" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn "The Rails Way" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.

The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:

Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.

Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: To apply as a student for the Ruby on Rails organization, you should send your application following this template : https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/Ruby-on-Rails-Application-Template

It's also a big plus if you're able to send a tiny patch (even documentation) to the project you are willing to work on.

### Description

The [SciRuby project](www.sciruby.com) is oriented towards providing computational research infrastructure for the Ruby Programming Language. SciRuby consists of a [fairly large number of gems](https://goo.gl/uWnVub), including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, rubex, rbcuda, and NMatrix.

NMatrix [has been awarded grants](https://goo.gl/zSycrJ) by the [Ruby Association](https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T) in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. Statsample and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while daru, nyaplot and gnuplotrb take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was awarded the [Ruby Association Grant in 2014](https://goo.gl/usseDY), Rubex and tensorflow.rb [received it in 2016](https://goo.gl/QNiMq9) and RbCUDA in [2017](http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/news/20171206).

Working on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. In fact, all the grants issued by the Ruby Association (which is headed by Matz) in 2016 (and most in 2017)  have gone to scientific projects.

Since we are first and foremost a science-related project, we expect successful student projects to lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research.

### Description

Mathematicians, scientists, researchers, and students need a powerful tool for their work or study. SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.

The mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.

Python is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.

Almost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.

### Description

# A Scalable language
Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.
Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.
# Object-Oriented
Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.
# Functional
Even though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.
# Seamless Java Interop
Scala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.
# Fun
Maybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”

### Description

Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.

ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.

ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.

- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.

- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Your application has two important purposes: It should clearly identify the goals of your project, and it should convince us that you are the right person for this task.

In particular, your application is your opportunity to show us that you understand what you'll be doing for the task, and to demonstrate that you've spent some time thinking about it, its difficulties, strategies for overcoming these, and have a good estimate of how much time they will take. Based on that, we will ask you a realistic planning for the 12 weeks of GSoC, including the deliverables expected at mid-term and at the end of the GSoC. In order to be complete, we also expect you to make a pull request, for example for a bug fix. The purpose is to ensure you know how to use Git, and that you had a look at our coding conventions.

We don't expect you to produce a perfect application without any help at all. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plans and your application with us while you're preparing it, to ensure your ideas align well with our own thoughts on the tasks, and that your objectives are achievable. It is also the perfect chance to already get to know your potential mentors and the rest of the team. Don't hesitate to join the IRC channels and ask questions: keep in mind that there are no stupid questions!

Feel free to suggest your own ideas.
A more detailed list of ideas (with descriptions) can be found at <https://www.sosy-lab.org/gsoc/gsoc2018.php#ideas> .

# CPAchecker ( [website](https://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org) )

CPAchecker is an [award-winning](https://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org/achieve.php) open-source framework
for the verification of software.
It is written in Java and based on a highly modular architecture
that allows to develop and combine a wide range of different analyses.
CPAchecker is used for [verification of the Linux kernel](http://linuxtesting.org/ldv)
and has helped to find [more than 50 bugs in the kernel](http://linuxtesting.org/results/ldv-cpachecker).

## Ideas
- Eclipse plugin
- Angular and automated tests for verification report
- Integrating SymPy into CPAchecker for Invariant Generation
- DART-like Test-case Generation in CPAchecker
- Checking Equivalence of Program Semantics Automatically

# JavaSMT ( [website](https://github.com/sosy-lab/java-smt) )

JavaSMT is a common API layer for accessing various SMT solvers.
It was created out of our experience integrating and using different SMT solvers in the CPAchecker project.
JavaSMT can express formulas in the theory of
integers, rationals, bitvectors, floating-points, and uninterpreted-functions,
and supports model generation, interpolation, formula inspection and transformation.

## Ideas
- Integrate more SMT solvers
- SMT in the Cloud

# BenchExec ( [website](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec) )

BenchExec is a benchmarking framework for Linux (written in Python)
that is aimed at a high reliability of the results.
It can measure the CPU-time and peak memory usage of whole groups of processes.
To do so, it makes use of modern Linux features such as cgroups and namespaces,
effectively creating a benchmarking container whose resource usage is measured.

## Ideas
- Make use of the Intel Cache Allocation Technology
- Modern architecture and tests for HTML tables

### Description

The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed. Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow. While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX.

HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability. This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable. HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.

### Description

Sugar Labs, a volunteer-driven, non-profit organization, had its origins in the One Laptop Per Child project and is has been a member project of the Software Freedom Conservancy since 2008.

At Sugar Labs, we make a collection of tools (Sugar) that learners use to explore, discover, create, and reflect. We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their learning.

Sugar is both a desktop and a collection of Activities. Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time collaboration.

* Sugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write, share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.
* Activities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.
* Automatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.
* The Sugar Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.
* Sugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.
* Sugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python language and easily customized.
* Sugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.
* Sugar is largely written and maintained by its users.
* Sugarizer is a fork of Sugar available for tablets and phones.
* Turtle Blocks and Music Blocks are popular programming Apps that run in Sugar, Sugarizer, or stand-alone on the GNU/Linux desktop or in a browser.

### Description

Swift is a high-performance system programming language. It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.

* **Project title**
* **Detailed project description**
  * This is a more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences).  This should outline both the underlying problem trying to be solved as well as an elaboration of the technical approach to tackle that problem.
* **Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables**
* **Implementation plan**
   * This should outline how the work will be approached in stages, with milestones along the way that can be used to both evaluate the technical direction of the work as well as how much progress has been made.

### Description

Eclipse is an open source community that's focused around key principles of transparency, openness, and vendor neutrality. Transparency is a relatively easy concept to understand: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest. While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called "level playing field").

Naturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over [three hundred](https://projects.eclipse.org/) open source projects covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody. 

Eclipse projects build technology in areas such as [Internet of Things](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things), [Programming Languages and IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language), and [Runtimes](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime) like Jetty and [EE4J](http://www.eclipse.org/ee4j) (currently known as Java EE).

For those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on [Science](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) where researches from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.

You've probably heard about our market-leading software development tools; we have that, and so much more...

### Description

Founded in 1999, The Honeynet Project is an international, non-profit (501c3) research organization dedicated to improving the security of the Internet at no cost to the public.

Our achievements are based on the principles of open source and volunteer efforts, with all software or papers created being licensed as open source and made freely available to the community.

We help coordinate the development, deployment, advancement and research findings of honeypot and anti-malware related technologies. With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.

Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:

Awareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.

Tools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.

Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.

The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: This year we have a wide range of project ideas and are also interested in hearing your ideas too. Our projects cover a wide range of programming languages and technologies. Project idea difficulty can range from fairly challenging, low level systems type projects that are likely to appeal to pretty confident programmers, through interesting data analysis, to data presentation projects building more effective user interfaces. We are always interested in discussing a student's own project ideas, and actively aim to mentor high quality student ideas too. If you are unsure, we can help you form your ideas during the student proposal submission period. If you want to find out more, take a look at our project ideas web page, subscribe to our blog and public GSoC questions mailing list.Then come and say hello on the #gsoc-honeynet IRC channel on irc.freenode.net (you can connect via webchat if you are behind a firewall or don't have a command line client too). There you should find a mix of organizational admins, project mentors, past successful GSoC students, general Honeynet Project members and prospective students, so please don’t be nervous - feel free to ask questions and we will always try and get back to you (although we may be idle for an hour or two when we sleep :) ). If you prefer email, check out the link to our mailing list or use project@honeynet.org. We are looking forwards to hearing from you and hopefully collaborating on something awesome together this summer.

### Description

The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.

JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.

JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode. The minimum required skill is to be familiar with the Java programming language. Note that not all projects require a deep understanding of Java or JPF. Please look at the project descriptions to determine which skills are most important.

JPF is a software verification tool. It is a customizable virtual machine that enables the development of various verification algorithms. It will be to your advantage if you are familiar with formal methods, software testing, or model checking. However, JPF is where research meets development, so for many projects not being familiar with formal methods is not a show stopper. We are looking for students who are highly motivated, bright, willing to learn, and love to code.

You can find some project ideas on our [project ideas](https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core/wiki/GSoC-2018-Project-Ideas) page. Please note that this list is not exclusive. If you are interested in a project that is not listed here, and it is relevant to JPF, we would love to hear about it. You can either email it to us or share your idea in our mailing list. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding JPF and the GSoC program do not hesitate to email us. Join our IRC channel #jpf on freenode to engage in a discussion about JPF.

In order to apply to our organization, you need to submit a proposal to Google during the student application phase (03/12 - 03/27). Check out the [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) page for more information.

### Description

Are you interested in contributing to a widely-used performance evaluation tool for computer networking research? [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org) is a *discrete-event, packet-level network simulator* with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the [Overview/Statistics page](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/)), but in summary, we have a users mailing list ([Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users)) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.

### Description

The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.

We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.
The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.

At our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation! We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for
Android, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2018).
 
For GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. 

You should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UFcWh2IWqhICh4YIFNwtKUaWWXifaBB67rjPxbYzjbE/edit?usp=sharing).

### Description

Why syslog-ng?

With syslog-ng, you can collect logs from wide range of sources, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.

syslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, and correlate logs from across your infrastructure (even from routers, embedded systems) and store or route them to log analysis tools.

By integrating with the newest big data tools it is possible to deliver log messages to kafka and elasticsearch, even store logs in hdfs with high performance.

Support for common inputs

syslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.

Flexible data extraction

Working with unstructured data? That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.

Simplify complex log data

Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.

Databases destinations

If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle!), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis, if that's what you are after.

Message queue support

syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.

Support language bindings

Want to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.

### Description

Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.
The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.
This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. 
Tools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Students who want to apply to the Vega project should submit at least one patch through GitHub before submitting an application. The reason that we require this is to make sure that  you can set up your development environment and work with the development infrastructure. A possible patch can be a new tutorial, a new example visualization, or a bug fix for any issue. A list of examples that could be implemented is at https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues/1486. We have also marked issues that we think are suitable for newcomers on GitHub : https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22. 

A complete GSoC application should include a presentation of yourself. The ideal candidate should demonstrate excitements and the ability to successfully finish a project. To help you convince us, we encourage applications with a project plan. Our list of suggested projects (http://bit.ly/vega-gsoc-2018) is not exhaustive, and more importantly, each idea only includes a summary of what could be done. An application should describe how you think the project may be split up into milestones. For any UI projects, having initial mockups would be helpful. Proposals that affect the declarative specification should include examples.

### Description

[**TimVideos.us** is a _group_ of exciting projects](https://code.timvideos.us) which together create a system for doing both _recording and live event streaming_ for **conferences**, **meetings**, **user groups** and **other** presentations. 

We hope that, through our _projects_, the costs and expertise currently required to produce live streaming events will be reduced to near zero. We wish to develop a system where everyone has the ability to record presentations and host live remote participants across the globe.

Our projects include simple web development, to real time live video mixing software, to hardware and electronics! One of our biggest projects is the [HDMI2USB.tv project](https://hdmi2usb.tv).

## HDMI2USB.tv: Open video capture hardware + firmware

The HDMI2USB project develops affordable hardware options to record and stream HD videos (from HDMI & DisplayPort sources) for conferences, meetings and user groups.

We are currently developing our own hardware (the [Numato Opsis](https://hdmi2usb.tv/numato-opsis/)), and also [provide firmware](https://hdmi2usb.tv/firmware/) for various prototyping boards.

HDMI2USB started in 2013, and is an active ongoing project in its third iteration of hardware prototyping. Today you can download working firmware and have real capture happen. Get involved in contributing code both to the capture software + FPGA stack

Our aim is this becomes the defacto, incredibly affordable and easy to use video recording hardware for conferences, meetings and user groups worldwide.

**Find out more about HDMI2USB and why we're doing this in [ABOUT + FAQ](https://hdmi2usb.tv/faq/)**

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: First, **please start by reading our [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/)** which includes a lot of important information on how to ask for help and writing a good proposal.

Once you have read the [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) you can go to the [contributing page](https://code.timvideos.us/contribute/) which will try and figure out which project best fits your interests and skills. The page will eventually take you to our [getting started issue tracker](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues) which includes our most fleshed out ideas for projects, many of which are suitable for GSoC.

We encourage students to figure out which idea excites them the most! A student who is interested in their project is more likely to write a good proposal and get accepted. As selecting a project or understanding an idea can be hard, we recommend you come join us [on IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=timvideos) and talk to us further about them. Good students are engaged with the community before GSoC even starts!

Once you have found a project you are interested in working on, go to the issue tracker for the project and look for bugs marked "Good First Bug". These bugs are simple enough that you should with some help be able try to fix them. Submitting a bug fix shows that you have understood the project enough to get things set up and while **not** required is a strong positive signal we will use when assessing your application.

As mentioned in the [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) page, mentors and the community are happy to review applications and give feedback. This will drastically improve the quality of your application and give you a better chance of being accepted.

### Description

TLA stands for the Temporal Logic of Actions, but it has become a shorthand for referring to the TLA+ specification language and the PlusCal algorithm language, together with their associated tools.

TLA+ is based on the idea that the best way to describe things formally is with simple mathematics, and that a specification language should contain as little as possible beyond what is needed to write simple mathematics precisely. TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems.

PlusCal is an algorithm language that, at first glance, looks like a typical tiny toy programming language. However, a PlusCal expression can be any TLA+ expression, which means anything that can be expressed with mathematics. This makes PlusCal much more expressive than any (real or toy) programming language. A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification, to which the TLA+ tools can be applied.

The principal TLA+ tools are the TLC model checker and TLAPS, the TLA+ proof system. All the tools are normally used from the Toolbox, an IDE (integrated development environment). Go to the TLA home page to find out more about TLA.

### Application Instructions

### Description

We develop visualizations to help scientists to make sense of copious and diverse types of genomic data. Our web-based data browser helps scientists make inferences and test hypotheses. Unique and important in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to combine their private data securely with public data using a decoupled server-client architecture. We are funded for the next 5 years by the National Cancer Institute as a genomic data visualization center to develop tools to visualize the largest compendium of cancer genomics data, the Genomic Data Commons. While we are funded nationally, our users are international, with only 40% of our traffic coming from within the United States. Last month we had over 3,500 users. We are committed to open-source software from the beginning and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our [static interval tree](http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree), [KM statistics](http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier) and [ICGC plugin](http://xena.ucsc.edu/integration-icgc-portal/)). 

Students we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger [UCSC Genomics Institute]( https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/), whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease. We are committed to working with students to ensure that they gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and useful code to the project. 

We are interested in finding long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genetics, statistics, data visualization, database query, or functional programing, please contact us as soon as possible. We want to help all students submit the best possible proposal.

### Description

ViSP standing for Visual Servoing Platform allows prototyping and developing applications using computer vision, visual tracking and visual servoing techniques at the heart of the [Lagadic](https://team.inria.fr/lagadic) research. ViSP was designed to be independent from the hardware, to be simple to use, expandable and cross-platform. ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.

Releases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip. ViSP is also packaged as binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, OSX, iOS, and for ROS framework.

The user site is at https://visp.inria.fr/. The developer site is at: https://github.com/lagadic/visp/wiki. Nightly builds of the documentation are at: http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/. Code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/lagadic/visp. Inspired from OpenCV we also propose visp_contrib (new algorithms, applications and future GSoC contributions, related tutorials and samples code): https://github.com/lagadic/visp_contrib.git. Downloads for various OS and mobile devices: https://visp.inria.fr/download/.

### Description

**webpack is a module bundler**. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

## Overview

Currently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM). 

## What makes webpack unique?

**Extensibility** webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system. 

**Focused around Web Performance** webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as "code splitting". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.

**Built in JavaScript** webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve. 

**Used at Scale** webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.

**Community Owned** webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: **We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](http://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](http://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins. 

We are looking for students who are passionate about JavaScript, in addition to building a faster web for everyone. You might love webpack if you are obsessed with JavaScript performance, Compilers, Multithreading in JavaScript, Parsers, AST, Module formats, caching and memoization, or if you want to simply make a impact on our 10 million monthly downloaders. 

There are multiple tags here that you can choose from. We ask that you choose a proposal type if your idea is applicable, in addition to tagging one the org tags (webpack / webpack-contrib).

### Description

WorldBrain’s mission is to make it easier for people to organise, recover, and share the most useful and trustworthy content they find on the web.
To do that, we built Memex. An open-source bookmarking tool for great thinkers: the researchers, scientists, academics, students, polemics, publishers, reporters, and writers who want to make the world a better place using facts, research, and verified information.

With Memex  we want to help you ease the frustration of not being able to find something you’ve seen online, whether it’s a website, a post on social media, a useful comment, or important quote.
Users can find things again, by searching for every word of every website visited – plus they can filter by domain, custom tags or time.
Also users can create links to highlights of articles, they can send to other people.  

Memex is built with full privacy and data ownership in mind. 
All data is stored locally on a user’s own computer. You can also pause indexing, or to blacklist domains or URLs. 

Our long-term vision is to battle online misinformation, by enabling users to build on the past web-research of other people, and break out of their filter bubbles by comparing multiple different opinions. (worldbrain.io/vision)

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: First of all, great that you are still reading and are interested in joining our project for GSoC 2018. 
(good choice) :)
Built on the experiences of the last year, we want to reduce unnecessary work on both ends.
Hence we appreciate you reading the following pointers on if and how to apply. 

### Prerequisits
1) Be or become a user of our Memex. 
2) You want to contribute to this project, not just for the sake of having a project, but because you think what we do is pretty awesome and useful to yourself. 
3) Think carefully if your current skill level allows you to make meaningful contributions. We're asking bc unfortunately, we don't have the resources to help you learn basic programming skills in the languages/frameworks we use. Please give us a feel for the kind of projects you have been working on so far.
4) Think equally carefully about what you want to learn in the next year, so we can help you achieve your learning goal during the summer and thereafter. 
5) For a successful application a (well) thought out plan on how to reach your project's goal is necessary.  6) #5 will require you already start hacking on some smaller things/preparations beforehand. Also it helps us getting a feel for how we work together :)

### Next Steps
Still interested? Great!

1) Drop by in our Slack channel and say 'hi' in #intros. Include some trivia information about you and add the answers to the questions 3 & 4.
2) Then we'll find a suitable test issue to work on for you
3) Happy hacking :)

### Description

The X.Org Foundation (or X.Org for short) is a foundation chartered to develop and execute effective strategies that provide worldwide stewardship and encouragement of the X Window System and related projects. Indeed, X.Org is much broader than just the X Window System. Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.

Today, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.

Come help us make the future more open!

### Application Instructions

    forum/e-mail:
    Summary: A somewhat small but explanatory walk through of the project. It should not be overly detailed just enough to understand the problem trying to be fixed and how this project opt to solve it.
    How will I achieve this: Explain how the project will be done, what technologies are needed and how to implement them.
    What will the project focus on: Explain what the project will focus on, what is the important parts of the project.
    Benefits: Who will benefit and why from this project. Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.
    Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.
    What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.

### Description

The xi-editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor,
using modern software engineering techniques. It is initially built for
Mac OS X, using Cocoa for the user interface. There are also frontends for
other operating systems available from third-party developers.

Goals include:

* ***Incredibly high performance***. All editing operations should commit and paint
  in under 16ms. The editor should never make you wait for anything.

* ***Beauty***. The editor should fit well on a modern desktop, and not look like a
  throwback from the ’80s or ’90s. Text drawing should be done with the best
  technology available (Core Text on Mac, DirectWrite on Windows, etc.), and
  support Unicode fully.

* ***Reliability***. Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.

* ***Developer friendliness***. It should be easy to customize xi editor, whether
  by adding plug-ins or hacking on the core.

Please refer to the [November 2017 roadmap](https://github.com/google/xi-editor/issues/437)
to learn more about planned features.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: The best way to apply is to pick a major project on the roadmap or in the issue tracker, and indicate that you want to work on it - can be in the issue if you don't mind your interest being public, or privately.

A major focus this summer will be building out the plug-in ecosystem (currently there's a fairly complete syntax highlighting plugin but the rest are prototypes). Great projects would include:

* Connecting xi-editor to the Language Server protocol

* Building really good code search features, perhaps using kythe as the back-end

* Using parser expression grammars (PEGs) to make a higher performance syntax highlighter

* Extending the UI and writing a plugin for version control (git) integration

### Description

XWiki is an open source software development platform based on the wiki principles, under the LGPL license. In addition to being a full-featured wiki, it is also a second generation wiki allowing effortless development of collaborative web applications. On top of this platform a plethora of applications are developed, targeted mainly on aiding enterprise-level needs.

XWiki has a vibrant community of developers and users, consisting of individual users as well as organizations around the world that are using XWiki for their own Communities or Intranets.

Within XWiki, the development involves several levels: server-side platform programming in Java with Servlet technologies, server-side application development in Velocity, Groovy, and client-side development in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

We propose projects that cover server-side Servlet programming and client-side rich application development, together with usability and performance improvements.

### Description

Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and [much more](https://zulipchat.com/features) -- essentially everything you might want.

Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.

Zulip is known for its [extensive developer documentation](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html) (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.

As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.

### Application Instructions

* Twitter: Since the required skills vary depending on which part of the project a student is working on, we have collected the application guidance on our [GSoC ideas page](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/gsoc-ideas.html), where it can be integrated with discussion of the various project ideas.
