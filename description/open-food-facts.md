## A food and cosmetic product database ##

Open Food Facts is a database of food and cosmetic products with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the ata we can find on product labels.

## Made by everyone ##

Open Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
Since 2012, 7000+ contributors have added 400 000+ products from 180 countries using the Android, iPhone or Windows Phone apps or their cameras to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

## For everyone ##

Data about food and cosmetics is of public interest and has to be open. The complete database is published as open data under the Open Database Licence (ODbL) and can be reused by anyone and for any use. There are more than 100 re-uses of the data in many different ways: many nutrition apps to eat better, food inventory apps to prevent waste, research by health and nutrition scientists, investigations by journalists, educative games etc.

## Make better food choices ##
Food additives, allergens, packaging codes: Open Food Facts helps you make sense of the fine print on products labels. Also, you can easily compare products in 3-clicks, so that you can make more informed choices.
