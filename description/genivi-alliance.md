[Back to catalogue](../README.md#genivi-alliance)

The GENIVI Alliance provides standards and an open connectivity platform that accelerates innovative solutions based on open software for In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems and connected vehicles.

The alliance has built a strong a community where automotive experts and thought leaders from related industries (e.g., content providers, mobility, etc.) can collaborate to produce adoptable standards and open source code.  These collaborations are often based on industry trends that require collaborative development of solutions for increased functionality in automobiles.  GENIVI has become a community where ecosystems outside of the automotive industry can meet and leverage the global automaker and supplier network in the GENIVI membership.

GENIVI is accelerating innovation within the automotive ecosystem and driving initiatives founded on leading trends including system on a chip (SOC) consolidation, advanced user interfaces, software-over-the-air (SOTA), car-to-cloud connectivity and entertainment in autonomous vehicles. 

An example of automotive trends meeting open technology is the GENIVI Vehicle Domain Interaction Strategy. GENIVI, in collaboration with other global technology providers, is developing open standard interfaces and code that bridge multiple car software domains. 

GENIVI has also delivered multiple software components that have been adopted and deployed in production vehicles worldwide.  Developed by GENIVI, several standard interfaces (APIs) have been adopted in many commercial and open source solutions.  These software components and interfaces are combined into a buildable baseline (based on Yocto Projectâ€™s meta-ivi layer) as well.  This baseline is the basis of the GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) that is an open source, automotive development platform where prototypes and innovative IVI and connected vehicle solutions can be rapidly developed and tested.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: First thing you need to do is get in touch with potential mentors and let me them know about your interest. Second, you'll likely want to review GENIVI projects and a widely used integration target called [GDP](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11567210)

Since DBus is involved in many of the projects, you're advized to learn about it and play with it a bit in C++.

Please sign up for our mailing list: https://lists.genivi.org/mailman/listinfo/genivi-projects where the mentors participate.

Hang out on our IRC channel as much as possible: #automotive on irc.freenode.net . Please note that this channels is shared with Automated Grade Linux project.

IRC and mailing-lista are also good place for seeking help if/when you get into trouble with anything.
