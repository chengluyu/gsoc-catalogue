# [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/)

[Back to catalogue](../README.md#r-project-for-statistical-computing)

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

- an effective data handling and storage facility,
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.

The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.

R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: 1. look for a project that you are interested in on
https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects

2. Each project should have "tests" students can complete to demonstrate
relevant skills. After completing at least one test, please post your
test results to a github repo, and add a link to your test results on
the wiki.

3. Send an email to the mentors of the project. Include a link to your
test results, and explain why you are interested in the project.

4. If you and the project mentors agree that you are capable of the
project, then you should work with the mentors to draft a proposal to
submit to Google. It should include most of the details from the
project proposal wiki page, and additionally a detailed timeline that
explains your plan for writing code, documentation, and tests.

5. Once your mentors have proof-read your proposal, submit it to google 
https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/

More details are on the R GSOC projects wiki.
