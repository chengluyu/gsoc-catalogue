FreeType font rendering library
----

FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

It is written in C, designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap font formats.

Some products that use FreeType for rendering fonts on screen or on paper, either exclusively or partially:

* GNU/Linux and other free Unix operating system derivates like FreeBSD or NetBSD;
* iOS, Apple's mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads;
* Android, Google's operating system for smartphones and tablet computers;
* ChromeOS, Google's operating system for laptop computers;
* ReactOS, a free open source operating system based on the best design principles found in the Windows NT architecture;
* Ghostscript, a PostScript interpreter used in many printers.

Counting the above products only, you get more than a _billion_ devices that contain FreeType.
