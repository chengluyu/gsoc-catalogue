The **Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at United Nations Foundation** has launched its **Open Source Center** to provide a collaborative space for (and professional technical assistance to) open source projects focusing on international development and humanitarian response. 

**We are a Google Summer of Code umbrella organization that works with many of the leading projects in this area,** including Humanitarian Open Street Map Team, OpenLMIS, SUMSarizer, LibreHealth, and Open Data Kit. 

Our Center assists in the establishment of effective governance, software project management, and contribution models for member projects. It also provides technical, architectural, and programming support for projects; and assists those projects in support, engagement, management of their communities of contributors and implementers. More information about the DIAL Open Source Center is available at http://osc.dial.community/. 

**This year, our sub-organizations include:**

 - **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)**, applying the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development.
 - **OpenLMIS**, an open source, cloud-based, electronic logistics management information system (LMIS) purpose-built to manage health commodity supply chains.
 - **SUMSarizer**, which helps researchers measure impacts of improved cookstoves by using machine learning to turn raw data from stove use monitoring sensors (SUMS) into summaries of cooking events.
