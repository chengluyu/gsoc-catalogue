[Back to catalogue](../README.md#opencensus)

OpenCensus is the open source version of Googleâ€™s census library, written based on years of optimization and experience. It is an open source project that aims to make the collection and submission of app metrics and traces easier for developers. It is a vendor neutral, single distribution of libraries that automatically collects traces and metrics from your app, displays them locally, and sends them to any analysis tools like Prometheus, Stackdriver, Zipkin and Prometheus.
