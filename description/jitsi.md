Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.

Jitsi Desktop (previously SIP Communicator) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP,  Bonjour, etc. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, macOS, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. 
The Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects such as 
ice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)
libjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)
Jitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)
Jitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)
Together with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.
The development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.
