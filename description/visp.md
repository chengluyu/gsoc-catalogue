[Back to catalogue](../README.md#visp)

ViSP standing for Visual Servoing Platform allows prototyping and developing applications using computer vision, visual tracking and visual servoing techniques at the heart of the [Lagadic](https://team.inria.fr/lagadic) research. ViSP was designed to be independent from the hardware, to be simple to use, expandable and cross-platform. ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.

Releases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip. ViSP is also packaged as binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, OSX, iOS, and for ROS framework.

The user site is at https://visp.inria.fr/. The developer site is at: https://github.com/lagadic/visp/wiki. Nightly builds of the documentation are at: http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/. Code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/lagadic/visp. Inspired from OpenCV we also propose visp_contrib (new algorithms, applications and future GSoC contributions, related tutorials and samples code): https://github.com/lagadic/visp_contrib.git. Downloads for various OS and mobile devices: https://visp.inria.fr/download/. More than 64 tutorials are available to help the user: http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/index.html#tutorial.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: * You must already know how to program fluently in C++ and depending on the project you may now Unity, Android, Blender, python
* Take your time to learn about ViSP (https://visp.inria.fr/), watching some YouTube videos (https://www.youtube.com/user/VispTeam/videos), reading tutorials (http://visp-doc.inria.fr/doxygen/visp-daily/index.html#tutorial), downloading it and launching tutorials or example.
* Discuss projects with us between now and March
* In March, go to the GSoC site and sign up to be a student with ViSP
* Post the title of the project to the mailing list visp-gsoc-2018@inria.fr
   - Include name, email, age
   - Include how you think you are qualified to accomplish this project (skills, courses, relevant background)
   - Include country of origin, school you are enrolled in, Professor you work with (if any)
   - Include a projected timeline and milestones for the project
   - Precise which 3rd party libraries you plan to use
* Once (and if!) ViSP gets accepted as GSoC organisation this year, and we are told how many slots we will get and youâ€™ve signed up for a project with us in March
   - We will dispatch the students and projects to the appropriate mentors
   - Accepted students will be posted on the GSoC site in May (and we will notify the accepted students ourselves).
