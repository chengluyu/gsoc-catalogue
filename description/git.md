[Back to catalogue](../README.md#git)

Git is the most widely-used revision control system in Open Source. It is a distributed system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Many large and successful projects use Git, including the Linux Kernel, Perl, Eclipse, Gnome, KDE, Qt, Ruby on Rails, Android, PostgreSQL, Debian, and X.org.

This organization covers projects for [Git](https://github.com/git/git) itself. Students may also propose
projects related to [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.io/). Other git-based software or services are not covered by this organization.
