[Back to catalogue](../README.md#openstreetmap)

OpenStreetMap is a project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world. The data is collected by volunteers around the globe largely from scratch and released with an open-content license. We allow free access to our map images and all of its underlying map data. We aim to promote new and interesting uses of our data which makes the project's uses, and the possible Google Summer of Code projects, very diverse.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: We have had good experiences with students who introduced themselves to our community and their respective mentor in advance. It helps to get the student and mentor know to each other, to know if they can work together and to elaborate on the details expected for a specific project. This also improves the timeline that has to be provided by our students. Depending on the project or mentor, we might request a software prototype or to solve a small exercise to estimate the student's experience level and their ambition to work with us. For the application itself we will publish a template on our wiki page to help the student submit a good application with everything that's needed from our side. More details are published [here](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2018#Project_Proposal).
