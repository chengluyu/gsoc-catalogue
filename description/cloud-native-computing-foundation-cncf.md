[Back to catalogue](../README.md#cloud-native-computing-foundation-cncf)

The CNCF was founded in 2015 with the mission to promote cloud native computing across the industry and provide a home for the Kubernetes community and related open source projects. Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to be:

* Containerized. Each part (applications, processes, etc) is packaged in its own container. This facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and resource isolation.
* Dynamically orchestrated. Containers are actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.
* Microservices oriented. Applications are segmented into microservices. This significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.
