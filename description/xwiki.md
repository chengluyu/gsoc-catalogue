XWiki is an open source software development platform based on the wiki principles, under the LGPL license. In addition to being a full-featured wiki, it is also a second generation wiki allowing effortless development of collaborative web applications. On top of this platform a plethora of applications are developed, targeted mainly on aiding enterprise-level needs.

XWiki has a vibrant community of developers and users, consisting of individual users as well as organizations around the world that are using XWiki for their own Communities or Intranets.

Within XWiki, the development involves several levels: server-side platform programming in Java with Servlet technologies, server-side application development in Velocity, Groovy, and client-side development in JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

We propose projects that cover server-side Servlet programming and client-side rich application development, together with usability and performance improvements.
