The openSUSE project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux everywhere. openSUSE creates two of the world's best Linux distributions, working together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the worldwide Free and Open Source Software community.

The project is controlled by its community and relies on the contributions of individuals, working as testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists and ambassadors or developers. The project embraces a wide variety of technology, people with different levels of expertise, speaking different languages and having different cultural backgrounds.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Contact the mentor early to get to know his expectations is the most important task before start writing your proposal. All our projects have issues labeled as **good first issue** / **junior job**. We recommend you to make at least one contribution to the project as that will help you to find out if this is the right project for you and to write a proposal, but you do **not** need to send a lot pull requests. The decision to select a student is made based on the proposal and not in the number of previous contributions. Remember that quality is more important than quantity!

**Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.

**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.

**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.

**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits.

**About me:** Write a few lines about you.
