The VideoLAN project is lead and composed of a team of volunteers, that believes in the power of open source when dealing with multimedia.

We are known for developing and publishing the widely used VLC media player playing almost everything everywhere. Additionally, we provide advanced tools for multimedia processing as well as libraries for use in third party applications.

Our latest addition to our cone family is the VideoLAN Movie Creator, a non-linear movie editor based on VLC technology and in the spotlight of this year's GSoC participation alongside interesting ports to embedded and mobile devices.
