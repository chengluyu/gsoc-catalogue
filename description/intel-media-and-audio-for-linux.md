[Back to catalogue](../README.md#intel-media-and-audio-for-linux)

Intel Media and Audio for Linux is a  family of media software, including libVA, VAAPI-Intel-Driver, gstreamer-vaapi, libyami and libxcam. libVA is an open source software library and API specification to provide access to hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding and video processing. VAAPI-Intel-Driver is open source hardware accelerated video driver for Intel integrated graphics based on libVA. Gstreamer-vaapi is a GStreamer plugin that allows hardware accelerated video processing through libVA. libyami is an open source video codec library to accelerate video decoding/encoding based on libVA. libxcam is an open source camera library to support computational photography features like 3A and image processing. All of these projects increase the speed and performance of decoding and encoding compressed digital video, imaging and audio. They also support workload offloading from the CPU to the GPU. 

These projects are provided for operating system vendors, systems integrators, and original device manufacturers who are creating branded or customized operating systems for embedded devices, phones, tablets, convertibles, desktops, gaming and entertainment systems and more.  Independent software vendors that create applications and games can also take advantage of the freely available source code and binaries.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please have a look into the list of ideas provided here first: https://01.org/linuxmedia/gsoc-2018-ideas

Students are encouraged to contact us before submitting their proposals.
We would like to club few bug fixes as subtasks for most of the ideas listed in wiki pages. The mentors can help you for this.

It is highly recommended to start reading wiki-pages first. Setting the development environment and playing with the sample applications (most of our projects have example applications) is a good thing to do before writing the proposal.

We prefer to have the technical details in each proposal than some "due date schedule of six months coding".

Students can come up with their own ideas too.
