# [Jenkins project](https://jenkins.io/)

[Back to catalogue](../README.md#jenkins-project)

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), originally founded in 2006 as "Hudson", is one of the leading automation servers available. Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. Jenkins core is open-source ([MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php))

The project has about 400 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc. In total we have around 2000 different components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities. The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages.
This year we invite students to join the Jenkins community and to work together on Jenkins plugins in order to improve Jenkins user experience and reliability.
