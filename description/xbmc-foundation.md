Kodi is a free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub for digital media. Kodi is available for Linux, OSX, iOS, Android, and Windows, running on both x86 and ARM-based processors, including the Raspberry Pi. Created in 2003 by a group of like minded programmers, Kodi is a non-profit project run and developed by volunteers located around the world. More than 50 software developers have contributed to Kodi, and 100-plus translators have worked to expand its reach, making it available in more than 30 languages.

PROJECT TITLE GOES HERE

    Name:
    forum/e-mail:
    Summary: A somewhat small but explanatory walk through of the project. It should not be overly detailed just enough to understand the problem trying to be fixed and how this project opt to solve it.
    How will I achieve this: Explain how the project will be done, what technologies are needed and how to implement them.
    What will the project focus on: Explain what the project will focus on, what is the important parts of the project.
    Benefits: Who will benefit and why from this project. Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.
    Goals: What is the goal of the project, a project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take to much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skill and deduct that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this perhaps its better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.
    What does it touch in Kodi: Think about what parts of the code this may touch, Kodi is a big application and a lot of the code is spread out and very complex. If a project touches to much it may be impossible to complete.
    Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge what hardware etc.
    Possible mentors: Place to add possible mentors (Team-Kodi will add this).
