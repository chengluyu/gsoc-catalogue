# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Students are expected to submit some code as part of the application process to show that they have an understanding of the project. Mentors and other project members will help coach students through submitting a proper pull request, for students who are unfamiliar with the Github workflow.

Students are strongly encouraged to introduce themselves on the [developers mailing list](https://lists.phpmyadmin.net/mailman/listinfo/developers). Nearly all project development discussion is handled through this mailing list, so it's helpful to subscribe and discuss your planned implementation.

Finally, submit your application through the Google site, and keep an eye out for mentor comments or questions. If the mentors have questions, concerns, or need any clarification they will ask through the GSoC site. Please use the application questions from the [student application template](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki/GSoC_2018_student_application_template).

Full application instructions are also posted on our [GSoC wiki page](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki/GSoC_home)
