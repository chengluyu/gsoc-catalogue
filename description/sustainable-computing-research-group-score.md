The Sustainable Computing Research Lab (SCoRe) has conducted research covering various aspects of mobile, cloud, iot, digital forensic, information security and more. The goal of our research is to generate computing solutions through identifying low-cost methodologies and strategies that lead to sustainabilityâ€‹.

At present, the SCoRe Lab is at a stage of its evolution in which it has been able to secure high donor confidence as evidenced by no less than 5 simultaneous foreign funded projects underway since 2005. SCoRe Lab has been a pioneer in cooperating with Internet Society (ISOC), Swedish Agency for International Development Cooperation (Sida)/The Department for Research Cooperation (SAREC), The Swedish Program for Information and Communication Technology in Developing Regions (Spider) and Information Society Innovation Fund (ISIF) in the area of computer science by establishing several interesting ICT research projects. These projects are considered to be the benchmarks of such projects in the World.
