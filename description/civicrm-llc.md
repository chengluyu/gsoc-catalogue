CiviCRM is an open source CRM built by a community of contributors and supporters, and coordinated by the Core Team. CiviCRM is web-based software used by a diverse range of organisations, particularly not-for-profit organizations (nonprofits and civic sector organizations). CiviCRM offers a complete feature set out of the box and can integrate with your website.

CiviCRM is created and used by a global community of tens of thousands of individuals and organisations. Our vision is that 'all organisations – regardless of their size, budget, or focus – have access to an amazing CRM to engage their contacts and achieve their missions'. Our roadmap outlines the shorter term goals we are implementing to acheive our vision.

At the center of our community is a Core Team of staff that are employed to co-ordinate and provide leadership for the project, and to serve our users and service providers. Many of the organisations involved with CiviCRM choose to become members and partners with us. By doing so they help to secure our financial stability and their investment in CiviCRM - you can join them.

There are many different ways to get involved with CiviCRM. Our community guidelines aim to help people to get involved with our community, understand how we work together, and what we expect of each other.

CiviCRM is released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (GNU AGPL v3).

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Check out the preliminary list of project ideas at https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/blob/master/projects.md and a longer list at https://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Google+Summer+of+Code+-+2018. 

Feel free to try out the demo software at https://dmaster.demo.civicrm.org.

Most importantly, come to the GSoC channel as early as possible on our community chat space https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/gsoc. You'll need to register an account first at https://chat.civicrm.org/signup_email. Indicate you're interested in an existing project idea or that you have one of your own, or even that you just are interested in CiviCRM but none of the projects are quite right. 

People in the channel will help you create a good match between your interests and what would be a do-able project. This process will normally be a back and forth, with a project getting refined and changed from the original idea. We want to help you create as good a proposal as possible! 

We may reach out into the community to find experts in the area of your interest, or user organizations with an interest in your proposal. At some point we'll likely have you setup a gitlab account (https://lab.civicrm.org/community-team/gsoc2018/blob/master/gitlab-new-account.md)  and create an issue that will be a space where the project will be defined in more detail (see https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal). Then you'll submit the formal proposal to GSoC. 

Start early!
