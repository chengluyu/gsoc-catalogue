# [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/)

[Back to catalogue](../README.md#boost-c-libraries)

Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.

We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries are included in the C++ Standards Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) and in the new C++11 Standard. C++11 also includes several more Boost libraries in addition to those from TR1. More Boost libraries are proposed for standardization in C++17.

Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference related to Boost called C++ Now has been held in Aspen, Colorado each May. Boost has been a participant in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: After many extremely successful years of GSoC at Boost during, we are minded to keep in place the more rigorous candidate selection process which involves selecting every GSoC Boost candidate with a C++ programming test or provides links to at least 1,000 lines (excluding comments and whitespace) C++ library (not application nor solution) open source code. Then student shoud do the following:
1. Review the list of ideas from previous GSoC (https://svn.boost.org/trac10/wiki/SoCPrevious), the archives of the Boost mailing list (http://www.boost.org/community/groups.html#main) relating to GSoC.
2. Join the Boost mailing list and find a mentor who is an experienced Boost developer in one of the Boost libraries (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/) and subscribe at http://lists.boost.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/boost
3. Read all posts tagged [gsoc18], then students should write a well researched and intelligent message with [gsoc18] at the front of the subject line to the mailing list seeking a mentor interested so that to write a GSoC proposal to be submitted to Google.
4. Once a potential mentor and project idea is found, the student must write a project proposal which should follow this submission template https://svn.boost.org/trac10/wiki/SoCSubmissionTemplate

Potential mentors may add precanned project ideas with programming competency tests to this page below as GSoC approaches. These may prove useful in starting a discussion with potential mentor(s) whom the student should approach directly.
