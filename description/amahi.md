The Amahi Linux Home Server makes your home networking and storage simple. We like to call the Amahi servers HDAs, for "Home Digital Assistants." Each HDA delivers all the functionality you would want in a home server, while being easy to use from a web browser and mobile apps.

Amahi can turn popular Linux distributions into a simple to use networking, storage and app server. The server management is done through a friendly user interface (the "platform‚Äù). The platform allows controlling users login and storage access permissions, managing some network services like DHCP and DNS, as well as providing many apps that the users can install. The platform web interface is implemented in Ruby on Rails and runs in the web server along with other apps.

The installation process is done by installing the base distribution (Fedora at the moment) and after that, running the Amahi installer at the command line.

Once the installation is complete, the network services kick in, storage can be used and applications are installed by users. Some applications are Plugins (developed as an RoR "engine") and some are very popular open source apps and services.
