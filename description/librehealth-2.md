We currently have under our umbrella the following projects:
 * [LibreHealth Toolkit](http://librehealth.io/projects/lh-toolkit/), a foundational base for building Health IT tools
 * [LibreHealth EHR](http://librehealth.io/projects/lh-ehr/), an electronic health record derived from best practices and technology from leading open source systems
 * [LibreHealth Radiology](http://librehealth.io/projects/lh-radiology/), a specialized distribution of LibreHealth Toolkit customized for radiology health care professionals

Our GSoC student projects will address real-life needs of our projects to help improve delivery of health care around the world. We have a team of expert mentors with decades of experience to help you in your work. They will be continually adding project ideas to our forum at https://forums.librehealth.io/ideas, and we encourage you to suggest ideas too as you learn more about our projects. Come join us and bring open source innovation to health care!
