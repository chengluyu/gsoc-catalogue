[Back to catalogue](../README.md#mobile-robot-programming-toolkit-mrpt)

**Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit** provides developers with portable and well-tested **applications** and **C++ libraries** covering data structures and algorithms employed in common robotics research areas. It is open source, released under the BSD license. Limited wrappers exist for Python and MATLAB. MRPT runs under Windows, GNU/Linux on a PC or on ARM embedded platforms (e.g. Raspberry Pi 3)

Created in 2005 and with tens of thousands of downloads, MRPT libraries include:
* [SLAM/SfM solutions](http://www.mrpt.org/List_of_SLAM_algorithms)
* [3D(6D) geometry](http://www.mrpt.org/tutorials/programming/maths-and-geometry/2d_3d_geometry/)
* [SE(2)/SE(3) Lie groups](http://ingmec.ual.es/~jlblanco/papers/jlblanco2010geometry3D_techrep.pdf)
* [Probability density functions (pdfs)](http://reference.mrpt.org/stable/classmrpt_1_1utils_1_1_c_probability_density_function.html) over points, landmarks, poses and maps
* Bayesian inference ([Kalman filters](http://www.mrpt.org/Kalman_Filters), [particle filters](http://www.mrpt.org/tutorials/programming/statistics-and-bayes-filtering/particle_filters/)) for robot localization and mapping
* [Image processing](http://www.mrpt.org/tutorials/programming/images-image-processing-camera-models/)
* [Obstacle avoidance for autonomous vehicles.](http://www.mrpt.org/Obstacle_avoidance)

MRPT also provides GUI apps for [Stereo camera calibration](http://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/application-kinect-stereo-calib/), [dataset inspection](http://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/rawlogviewer/), and [much more](http://www.mrpt.org/list-of-mrpt-apps/).

MRPT was created in 2005 by [J.L.Blanco](https://github.com/jlblancoc), still its main developer, while working in the [MAPIR lab](http://mapir.isa.uma.es/mapirwebsite/) (University of MÃ¡laga).

MRPT is mentioned in [hundreds](http://www.mrpt.org/category/publications/) of scientific papers.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: ### Students interested in applying

  - You **must already** be proficient in C++.
  - Take your time to learn about [MRPT](http://www.mrpt.org/). Try watching some [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mrpt), reading [tutorials](http://www.mrpt.org/Tutorials), downloading it and launching demo applications, for example. Getting familiar with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and MRPT ROS packages would be a plus.
  - Take a look at the projects in the ["GSoC ideas page"](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/wiki/Ideas-page-for-MRPT-Google-Summer-of-Code-2018). Discuss those of your interest, or your own ideas, in the [MRPT forum/mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mrpt-users).
  - Read carefully about Google's student eligibility rules.
  - Sign up in [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and post your **project proposal** to the MRPT Organization. Your proposal **should include**: 
    - A coding portfolio of past/current projects.
    - Your GitHub/GitLab/... username.
    - A detailed description of your project proposal, including initial plans for research directions and a list of key and optional features to be coded as time permits.
    - Will you be working full-time on the project during the summer? Will you have other commitments too (a second job, classes, etc)?
    - Why do you feel motivated to undertake this particular project? :-)

Rules say that all communications between students and mentors **should** happen in public: please, use the MRPT mailing list or GitHub comments in pull-requests or commits whenever possible, before and during GSoC.
