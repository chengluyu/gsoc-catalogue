[Back to catalogue](../README.md#aossie-australian-open-source-software-innovation-and-education)

We are an Australian not-for-profit umbrella organization for open-source projects. We believe the open-source philosophy provides a resource-efficient channel to transfer knowledge and achieve innovation and education.

In 2018, we offer the following projects:

* **Agora** (Scala): a library of vote counting algorithms for democratic elections.
* **Scavenger** (Scala): an automated theorem prover for first-order logic.
* **Mind the Word** (JavaScript, HTML, CSS): a browser extension that helps users to learn new languages.
* **Carbon Footprint** (JavaScript, HTML, CSS): a browser extension that raises environmental awareness regarding C02 emissions.
* **Carbon Footprint - Mobile App** (React Native, Android, iOS): a mobile app that raises environmental awareness by tracking user activity and calculating carbon footprints.
* **Carbon Footprint - API** (JavaScript(Node.JS), MongoDB): A REST API that calculates Carbon Footprints of anything measurable.
* **Computational Philosophy** (Isabelle): formalizations of philosophical theories and arguments towards computer-assisted metaphysics, as envisaged by Leibniz.
* **Stardroid (a.k.a Google Sky Maps)** (Android/iOS): Sky Map is a hand-held planetarium for your Android device. Can be used to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more.
* **CrowdAlert** (React Native, Android, iOS): a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to post and view incidents around them.

We have a diverse group of mentors, including GSoC students from previous years who decided to become long-term contributors as well as academics with extensive experience in supervising undergraduate, M.Sc. and Ph.D. students on theses and projects, whose results are often published and presented in the most prestigious conferences of our research fields.

We are looking for excellent students who are interested in becoming long-term collaborators in our projects. If you are a prospective student interested in doing your GSoC project with us, drop us a line and start contributing.
