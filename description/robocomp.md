[Back to catalogue](../README.md#robocomp)

RoboComp is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: These are the steps you should follow when working on your application:
1. Familiarize with the software,  download, and use RoboComp: https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/master/README.md.
2. Go through the tutorials and direct your questions to the mailing list or gitter chat (listed below, also see contact section):  https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp/blob/master/doc/README.md.
3. Please read all the information posted in the ideas page before applying.
4. Make sure you are familiar with the required skills for the idea. 
5. Mentors and backup mentors are listed right after the idea explanation. All mentors contact info is in the ideas page. Contact them directly for specific questions on the idea.

As a result you should provide the following material in your application to the correct mentor and the backup mentor for review:
* Schedule proposal of your work during summer of code with proper milestones. 
* Code examples that prove your suitable for the task (better if they are small improvements of RoboComp in the line of the idea you are applying).
* CV and other applications materials  you want to include.

NOTE: If you send this by email make sure to also submit your application through the official GSoC website otherwise you will not be considered for the programme.
