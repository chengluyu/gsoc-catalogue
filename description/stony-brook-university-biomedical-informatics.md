Healthcare enterprises are producing large amounts of data through electronic medical records, medical imaging, health insurance claims, surveillance, and others. Such data have high potential to transform current healthcare to improve healthcare quality and prevent diseases, and advance biomedical research. Medical Informatics is an interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective use of medical data, information, and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving and decision making, driven by efforts to improve human health and well being.
The Department of Biomedical Informatics (BMI) is the home of biomedical data science research and education at Stony Brook University.  We train and prepare students and postdoctoral researchers to become leaders in the field. As we train the next generation of data scientists, we deliver innovative informatics research and applications to enhance scientific knowledge and healthcare delivery.
