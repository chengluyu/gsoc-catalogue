[Back to catalogue](../README.md#the-eta-programming-language)

Eta is a pure functional language designed for practical use modelled after Haskell. It has a combination of purity, laziness and strong typing making developers highly productive. These features allow developers to focus more on describing their problem rather than focusing on how to give commands to a machine on how to accomplish their task.

Eta runs on the Java Virtual Machine allowing large companies to integrate it into their existing systems. It provides a type-safe Foreign Function Interface (FFI) mechanism that allows you to access existing Java, Scala, Clojure, and Groovy libraries with ease while keeping the nice properties of the language.

Eta shares the compiler infrastructure with GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, which means it already has sophisticated optimizations that allow you to write high level code and get good performance as well.

Eta's runtime has a wide variety of concurrency mechanisms such as Software Transactional Memory, MVars, and Fibers to allow developers to build highly complex concurrent & distributed systems with ease.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Application Process

Read the student guide of GSoC (https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/). The application process is as follows:

1. Pick some ideas from the Ideas List(https://eta-lang.org/contribute/gsoc/2018#ideas) that interested you or think of your own.
2. Join the Google Group and start discussions about the ideas from (1) and solicit feedback from the community. 
3. Contribute at least one code patch to any of the [Eta](https://github.com/typelead) repositories. Check the issues labelled with [help-wanted](https://github.com/typelead/eta/labels/help%20wanted) and [low-hanging-fruit](https://github.com/typelead/eta/labels/low-hanging-fruit) to start with easy issues.
4. Develop your application in a shareable location like Google Docs or GitHub Gist and share your application for early review. Make sure the application follows the template(https://eta-lang.org/contribute/gsoc/2018#application-template).
5. Be sure to submit your application atleast a day before the deadline [March 27, 2018 at 1600 hours UTC]

The application template can be found here (https://eta-lang.org/contribute/gsoc/2018#application-template).
