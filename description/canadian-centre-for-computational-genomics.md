[Back to catalogue](../README.md#canadian-centre-for-computational-genomics)

The Montreal [C3G](http://computationalgenomics.ca/) node is hosted at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Center (MUGQIC).
The Montreal node is strongly involved with [GenAP](https://genap.ca/) and has developed several genomic data analysis pipelines.
Since 2011, we have completed more than 400 bioinformatics analysis projects with over 290 distinct groups of researchers across Canada.
Our teams have significant experience in personalized medicine applications.
These have included genome analysis and interpretation of personal genomes,
technology and services to record patient presentations, RNA- and ChIP-seq data analysis, and analysis of complete human epigenomes in both germline disorders and cancers.
Each year C3G co-organizes several international workshops about next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis.

The Montreal C3G node develops the [GenAP Pipes](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/mugqic_pipelines) which consist of Python scripts which create a list of jobs running Bash commands to analyze NGS data.
Those scripts support dependencies between jobs and a smart restart mechanism if some jobs fail during pipeline execution.
Job commands and parameters can be modified through several configuration files.
We currently maintain 7 pipelines and are in the process of developing 3 others.

The Montreal C3G node also develops other bioinformatics tools:
 
 * [BVAtools](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/bvatools)
 * [POPsv](https://github.com/jmonlong/PopSV)
 * [SCoNEs](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/scones)

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: How to apply to our projects:   

    1 Look for a project that needs a student on https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/gsoc_2018/overview
    2 Each project should have ?tests? students can complete to demonstrate relevant skills. After completing at least one test, please post your test results to a github/bitbucket repo, and add a link to your test results on the google group.
    3 Send an email to the mentors of the project. Include a link to your test results, and explain why you are interested in the project.
    4 **Do NOT submit any applications to google without getting approval from the mentors.** If the mentors judge that you are capable of the project, then they will respond and help you to write a proposal to submit to Google. It should include most of the details from the project proposal wiki page, and additionally a detailed time-line that explains your plan for writing code, documentation, and tests.
    5 Once your mentors have proof-read your proposal, submit it to google: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/
