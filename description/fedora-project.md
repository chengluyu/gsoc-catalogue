[Back to catalogue](../README.md#fedora-project)

The Fedora Project's core values, or Foundations, are Freedom, Friends, Features, & First. Read more about them here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Foundations

A key component of this is our **Community**. This community, which you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is creating a platform that supports the work of a diverse audience. Your contributions can affect people you've never met in situations you've never dreamed of. The Fedora community includes software engineers, artists, system administrators, web designers, writers, speakers, and translators -- all of whom will be happy to help you get started.

Full project description available here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview

We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and strength of our community.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Our application process is described completely here: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/mentored-projects/gsoc/2018/application.html

In general, we are looking for students to describe both their understanding of the project they are choosing (or their complete project if they are proposing one) and to help us understand why they are the best candidate for the project. This also includes helping us understand their availability and level of commitment. While prior experience with Fedora is ideal, it is not a selection requirement.
