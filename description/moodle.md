Moodle is widely used around the world by universities, schools, companies, and all manner of organizations and individuals who need to conduct education online. Many of our users take part in the community on moodle.org and contribute with ideas, debate, testing, education, documentation, bug fixing, feature writing and everything else that makes an open source project function.
