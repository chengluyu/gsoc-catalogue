gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please review the ideas at https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/summerofcode/ideas.md and apply using the regular Google Summer of Code process.

We want gRPC to be the universal protocol for all computing platforms and paradigms, so while these are our ideas of what we think would make good projects for the summer, weâ€™re eager to hear your ideas and proposals as well. Try us out and get to know the gRPC code and team!
