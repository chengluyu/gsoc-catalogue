# Non-profit organization that creates a computing platform for the general public

The GNOME project builds the technologies, platform, middle-ware, applications and environment to create a free software solution for using your personal computer. The GNOME project is:

## Independent

Our board is democratically elected, and technical decisions are made by the engineers doing the work. We are supported by many organizations; employees from over a hundred companies have contributed since the project began.

## Free

We believe that software should be developed in the open. Our development infrastructure and communication channels are public, and our code can be freely downloaded, modified and shared with others. All our contributors have the same rights.

## Connected

Our project is an important part of the Free Software ecosystem. We work with other free projects to create high-quality solutions that span the entire software stack.

## People-focused

Our software is translated into many languages and comes with built in accessibility features. This means that it can be used by anyone, regardless of the language they speak or their physical abilities.
