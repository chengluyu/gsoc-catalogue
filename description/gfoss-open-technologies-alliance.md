[Back to catalogue](../README.md#gfoss-open-technologies-alliance)

GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance  is a platform for Open Standards, Free Software, Open Content, Open Data & Open Hardware in Greece. The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute to coordinating the efforts of groups of volunteers, enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation.
