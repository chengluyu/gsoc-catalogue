JBoss Community is a community of open source projects. The community hosts a large number of projects that are written in various programming languages. The primary language is Java. But there are also projects that are written in Ruby, PHP, Node and other languages.

Project categories range from better testing support over IDEs, application servers, application and performance monitoring to micro-services.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Before submitting you should talk to the potential mentor(s) who can give you more details about the idea and clarify questions about the idea that you (should) have.

In your proposal you need to present yourself and why you want to work on the idea. The proposal needs to include a detailed timeline that shows what you will implement when. Of course you need to sync up with your mentor on it. Very important is to exactly qualify what you want to have achieved by mid-term.

It will be good for you if you start interacting with the project community and looking at existing code even if it is an uncertain bet on the future. In the past we got a lot more submissions from students than slots for students, so students that have already interacted (well) with the community will be in a better position in the selection process.

Some projects may not want to accept students that did not interact with the potential mentors and the project before. It may even be required so solve a task before being considered.
