[Back to catalogue](../README.md#apache-software-foundation)

The Foundation provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that simultaneously limits contributors potential legal exposure. Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process, Apache projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software products that attract large communities of users. The pragmatic Apache License makes it easy for all users, commercial and individual, to deploy Apache products.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: In order to apply we ask that you create

 * a list of deliverables, quantifiable results for the Apache community,
 * a detailed description / design document,
 * an approach,
 * an approximate schedule and
 * something of a background text.

We also need you to let us know what other commitments you have for the period of GSoC, for example, do you have any exams or a part time job? In other words - sell yourselves, as if this was an actual job.

In drawing up your proposal you need to work with your chosen projects community.

One of our evaluation criteria is that you have already engaged with the community to ensure that you understand the needs of the project and the commitment you need to make to your mentors.
