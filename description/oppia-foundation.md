# Why Oppia?
Oppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala

# Interactive learning
Oppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.

A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach. 

# Community-driven lesson creation
The other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: # Applying to Oppia
Please take a look at our dedicated GSoC 2018 wiki page [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2018) for information about project ideas, what we’re looking for in a proposal, a proposal template, and how to apply to our organization. We also strongly recommend taking a look at our [developer wiki](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki) in order to become familiar with our development process.

Please note that most Oppia work heavily involves AngularJS for frontend development, and Google App Engine with Python 2.7 for backend development. You will also need a GitHub account.
