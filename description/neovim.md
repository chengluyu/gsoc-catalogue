[Back to catalogue](../README.md#neovim)

Neovim is a refactor of the Vim text editor engineered to encourage new features, advanced UIs, and powerful extensions. 

Goals

    Provide a flexible, extensible Vim with a first-class, fast scripting alternative (lua/luajit)
    Provide a consistent user experience across platforms
    Maintain feature parity with Vim
    Continue the Vim tradition of backwards compatibility, with few exceptions
    Keep the core small and fast
    Target all platforms supported by libuv
    Delegate to plugins, but preserve the utility of the editor core
