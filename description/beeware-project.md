[Back to catalogue](../README.md#beeware-project)

Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:

* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,
* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,
* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,
* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.

# Python native
If Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. 

# Platform native
It's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.

# More than just code
We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: To begin the application process, fill in [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gcnGF28SuxbezZj72), providing your resume, and an essay, **no more than 1 page in length**, that covers the following three points:

* Tell your story. In particular, what led you to your current area of study?
* Why are you applying to the GSoC? In particular, why are you applying to the BeeWare Project?
* If you could build any cross-platform application (mobile, desktop or both) - what would you build?

We will blind review these initial applications to develop a short list of interesting applicants. We will invite those on the shortlist to complete a video interview. We will invite some interviewees to complete a short project, and develop a full project proposal. We will assess the process of working with you on this small project, and the quality of your project proposal, and use that as the basis for our slot request to the GSoC program.

It will be in your interest to start this application process early. If you submit your initial application hours before the GSoC application deadline, we won't have enough time to evaluate you fully.
