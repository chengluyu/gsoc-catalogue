[Back to catalogue](../README.md#openastronomy)

OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects that are used by researchers and engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the [Hubble Space Telescope](http://www.nasa.gov/hubble), the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg. [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft (eg. [HORIZONS](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi)). The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.

OpenAstronomy is currently formed by [12 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: 
- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; 
- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;
- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.
- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;
- And [more](http://openastronomy.org/members/)!

As a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our "sister" projects.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Do you want to participate with OpenAstronomy as part of the GSoC? First, read carefully the [student application guidelines](http://openastronomy.org/gsoc/student_guidelines.html) and [other guides available](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/). Pay close attention to the requirements, as without them we won't consider your application.
Learn from previous successful students (available in the sub-orgs wikis), and create your own with enough time to get feedback before the deadline.
