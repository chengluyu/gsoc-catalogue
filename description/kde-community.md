[Back to catalogue](../README.md#kde-community)

KDE is an international team co-operating on development and distribution of Free, Open Source Software for desktop and portable computing. Our community has developed a wide variety of applications for communication, work, education and entertainment. We have a strong focus on finding innovative solutions to old and new problems, creating a vibrant, open atmosphere for experimentation.

**Implementation**

Describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined above. 

**Timeline**

Show that you understand the problem, have a solution, have broken it down into manageable parts, and that you have a realistic plan on how to accomplish your goal. 

* Disclose other commitments during GSoC, such as a job, vacation, exams, internship, seminars, or papers to write.
* Explain how you will work around conflicts. If you are found to have conflicts which you did not disclose, you may be failed.
* Include your plans for communication in your proposal; daily is best, weekly at minimum.
* You will need to initiate weekly formal communication such as a blog post on the KDE Planet or detailed email to the team mail list. Lack of communication will result in you being failed.

* Prior contributions are required; list your commits. 
* Tell us if you are submitting proposals to other organizations, and whether or not you would choose KDE if given the choice.
