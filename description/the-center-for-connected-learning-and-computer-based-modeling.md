## What Is It?

NetLogo is a programming environment that helps everyday people to do science and programming. NetLogo has found a variety of uses around the world, from being used as a tool for helping to teach science in classrooms, to being an introductory programming environment, to enabling researchers worldwide to build computational models without needing extensive programming knowledge.

## Who Made It?

NetLogo is authored by Prof. Uri Wilensky, who heads Northwestern University's Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL). The CCL includes software engineers, educational researchers, curriculum developers, and students at Northwestern University all working together to design and develop creative technologies that deepen learning.

The CCL is funded by Northwestern University, the National Science Foundation, and a few commercial sponsors.
