[Back to catalogue](../README.md#metasploit)

The Metasploit Framework is both a penetration testing system and a development platform for creating security tools and exploits. The framework is used by network security professionals to perform penetration tests, system administrators to verify patch installations, product vendors to perform regression testing, and security researchers world-wide. The framework is written in the Ruby programming language and includes components written in C, many flavors of Assembly, Python, Powershell, PHP, and other languages.

The framework consists of tools, libraries, modules, and user interfaces. The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.

## Skillz

What programming languages are you familiar with, in order of proficiency? Most of Metasploit is written in Ruby; for any project you will most likely need at least a passing knowledge of it. If you want to work on Meterpreter or Mettle, C will be necessary as well.
