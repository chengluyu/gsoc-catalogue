Developers Italia is a community dedicated to the development of Open Source Software, created to support Italian digital public services.

It is a radical change in the way the Public Administration operates. Everything we are doing is operating with open standards and software, we are creating **SDKs** for the main programming languages and frameworks, we craft publicly documented **APIs**. We contribute to open projects, and the people we contract to improve the technology become **Open Source developers**.

Most of the code is deployed within the Italian public institutions, but it is meant to be generic, in the hope that it will be useful to many other people around the world. Around these tools we are engaging a community of developers and innovators, **inside and outside Italy**, that can participate in all aspects of the creation of the new digital infrastructure.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: # Remember: all ideas on the ideas page are... ideas! You can come up with your own proposal!
Here's a short list to ensure you're applying the best way you can
- Join the [Slack of Developers Italia](https://slack.developers.italia.it), introduce yourself, and meet your fellow developers
- Read [Google's instructions for participating](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and the [GSoC Student Manual](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/manual#student_manual)
- Take a look at the list of ideas
- Come up with project that you're interested in
- Write a first draft proposal and get someone to review it
- Remember: you must link to work such as commits in your proposal
- Read [How to write a kickass proposal for GSoC](http://teom.org/blog/kde/how-to-write-a-kick-ass-proposal-for-google-summer-of-code/)
- Submit your proposal and all necessary documents well ahead of the deadline

A good start is finding out what the most pressing issues are in the projects in which you are interested. 
Check out the github issues as well as join the relevant slack channels: meet developers and your potential mentor, as well as start learning the codebase. We recommend strongly getting involved in advance of the beginning of GSoC, and we will look favorably on applications from students who have already started to act like Open Source developers.

Always remember: this is a very brief instruction list - in any case of any doubts, just reach out to us, we're very happy to help new developers get started!
