NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software. Most individual projects, even the wildly successful ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for their community to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an umbrella organization for this projects.

The following projects will be participating under the NumFOCUS umbrella:

- [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) - A community led collection of recipes, build infrastructure and distributions for the conda package manager.
- [Data Retriever](http://www.data-retriever.org) - The Data Retriever is a package manager for data. 
- [FEniCS Project](https://fenicsproject.org) - FEniCS is an automated finite element library used to solve equations used in modeling, featuring a domain-specific language and automated code generation. 
- [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) - "Topic Modelling for Humans." Gensim is an open-source Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora.
- [Julia](https://julialang.org) - Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.
- [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) - MDAnalysis is a Python library to analyze trajectories from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
- [PyMC3](http://docs.pymc.io) - PyMC3 is a python module for Bayesian statistical modeling and model fitting which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms.
- [Stan](http://mc-stan.org) - Stan is a probabilistic programming language for data analysis, enabling automatic inference for a large class of statistical models.
- [Shogun](http://shogun.ml) - Shogun is and open-source machine learning library that offers a wide range of efficient and unified machine learning methods.
- [yt](http://yt-project.org) - yt is a community-developed analysis and visualization toolkit for examining datasets in a variety of scientific disciplines.
