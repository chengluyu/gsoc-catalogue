[Back to catalogue](../README.md#libvirt)

The libvirt project provides an API for managing the capabilities of many virtualization technologies, including KVM, QEMU, LXC, Xen, VMWare ESX, Parallels, OpenVZ, VirtualBox, Hyper-V and more. It includes bindings into many programming languages.

Libvirt is a library used by many applications with very different use cases like Jenkins, OpenStack, libguestfs, Munin, oVirt, Kimchi, virt-manager or Cuckoo.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: First you should have a look at the [GSoC Student Manual](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/). A good application will require the following items:

*  Present yourself
*  Prove that you want to get involved into libvirt
*  Explain what you want to achieve
*  How do you plan to achieve it?
*  Why should we choose you?

Including a realistic (even rough) schedule of the project will help us pick you up, and will help you during your project.

In order to get used to how the libvirt project works, we require all applicants to get a patch pushed for libvirt.
