The [IDRC](http://idrc.ocadu.ca) is the lead organization of the [Inclusive Design Institute (IDI)](http://inclusivedesign.ca), a collaboration of eight Ontario post secondary institutions, together focusing on the development of inclusive information technology. The IDRC is primarily a research and development organization, part of the [Faculty of Design at OCAD University](http://www.ocadu.ca/academics/faculty-of-design.htm) in Toronto. Its primary mandate is to promote access to information and information technology for all. Many of its activities involve working with international and local standards groups to introduce accessibility related specifications into their developing standards. It is an organization made up of computer scientists, engineers, educators, and practitioners, who all work together to develop leading edge technologies that are inclusive of everyone.
 
The IDRC and IDI are not-for-profit organizations. They offer services for people with disabilities, providing guidance on issues related to learning, technology use, and access to information.
