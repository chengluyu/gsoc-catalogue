The BEAM Community is a group of OSS projects that run on the Erlang VM. Our goal is to host relevant projects in the Erlang community, making it easy for those projects to participate in the Google Summer of Code and for interested students to pick their best choice. The Erlang VM was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.

Many companies around the world like Amazon, Heroku and Activision use the Erlang VM in their stack and open source projects like ejabberd, Riak, Phoenix, CouchDB, Zotonic, Nerves project and many more are built on top of it. Our currently hosted projects include the Elixir programming language, BarrelDB, a distributed database, LASP, a language for Distributed Eventually consistent computations, and ejabberd, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others. This gives students a wide range of choices, that goes from working on distributed systems, to maintaining robust servers and language design.
