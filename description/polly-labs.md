[Back to catalogue](../README.md#polly-labs)

Polly Labs is a multinational collaboration between academia and industry. Its mission is to advance research and software around the [Polyhedral Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_model).

Polyhedral compilation is a powerful technique to automatically optimize loop nests which often occur in scientific and multimedia code. Optimizations include parallelization (OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA, MPI, ...), vectorization, tiling, loop fusion, loop reversal, loop interchange and many more.

Polly Labs contributes software to the community itself, such as:

 * [Polly](https://polly.llvm.org/)
 * [Integer Set Library](http://isl.gforge.inria.fr/)
 * [barvinok](http://barvinok.gforge.inria.fr/)
 * [ppcg](http://ppcg.gforge.inria.fr/)
 * [Polyhedral Extraction Tool](http://pet.gforge.inria.fr/)
 * [PENCIL](https://github.com/pencil-language)

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please contact us before submitting a project. We will help you with writing proposal. Students who contacted us upfront have a much higher chance to be accepted.

Unless you already worked with our community, we will also ask you to complete a small task (e.g., fix a "newbie bug") such that we can have an idea whether you are prepared for the task.

For details and hints what makes a good proposal, please see our [How to apply page](http://pollylabs.org/gsoc-how-to-apply.html).
