[Back to catalogue](../README.md#worldbrainio-verifying-the-internet)

WorldBrain’s mission is to make it easier for people to organise, recover, and share the most useful and trustworthy content they find on the web.
To do that, we built Memex. An open-source bookmarking tool for great thinkers: the researchers, scientists, academics, students, polemics, publishers, reporters, and writers who want to make the world a better place using facts, research, and verified information.

With Memex  we want to help you ease the frustration of not being able to find something you’ve seen online, whether it’s a website, a post on social media, a useful comment, or important quote.
Users can find things again, by searching for every word of every website visited – plus they can filter by domain, custom tags or time.
Also users can create links to highlights of articles, they can send to other people.  

Memex is built with full privacy and data ownership in mind. 
All data is stored locally on a user’s own computer. You can also pause indexing, or to blacklist domains or URLs. 

Our long-term vision is to battle online misinformation, by enabling users to build on the past web-research of other people, and break out of their filter bubbles by comparing multiple different opinions. (worldbrain.io/vision)

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: First of all, great that you are still reading and are interested in joining our project for GSoC 2018. 
(good choice) :)
Built on the experiences of the last year, we want to reduce unnecessary work on both ends.
Hence we appreciate you reading the following pointers on if and how to apply. 

### Prerequisits
1) Be or become a user of our Memex. 
2) You want to contribute to this project, not just for the sake of having a project, but because you think what we do is pretty awesome and useful to yourself. 
3) Think carefully if your current skill level allows you to make meaningful contributions. We're asking bc unfortunately, we don't have the resources to help you learn basic programming skills in the languages/frameworks we use. Please give us a feel for the kind of projects you have been working on so far.
4) Think equally carefully about what you want to learn in the next year, so we can help you achieve your learning goal during the summer and thereafter. 
5) For a successful application a (well) thought out plan on how to reach your project's goal is necessary.  6) #5 will require you already start hacking on some smaller things/preparations beforehand. Also it helps us getting a feel for how we work together :)

### Next Steps
Still interested? Great!

1) Drop by in our Slack channel and say 'hi' in #intros. Include some trivia information about you and add the answers to the questions 3 & 4.
2) Then we'll find a suitable test issue to work on for you
3) Happy hacking :)
