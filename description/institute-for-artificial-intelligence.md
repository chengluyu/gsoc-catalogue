The Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IAI) at the University of Bremen, Germany, headed by Prof. Michael Beetz, investigates methods for cognition-enabled robot control. The research is at the intersection of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and includes methods for intelligent perception, dexterous object manipulation, plan-based robot control and knowledge representation for robots. Robots performing complex tasks in open domains, such as assisting humans in a household or collaboratively assembling products in a factory, need to have cognitive capabilities for interpreting their sensor data, understanding scenes, selecting and parameterizing their actions, recognizing and handling failures and interacting with humans. IAI develops solutions for these kinds of issues, implements and test them on the robots in our laboratory. A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: **Please read the up to date instructions from our [application page](http://ai.uni-bremen.de/teaching/gsoc2018)**. Every project will have a small test/tutorial that have to be fulfilled in order to consider the application of the student. We do this in order to avoid copy-paste applications from students. The tutorials/tests are relatively simple and only require students proof that they managed to install and the required software and write a possible 'Hello World' code snippet.
