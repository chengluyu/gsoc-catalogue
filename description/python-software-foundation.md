# [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/)

[Back to catalogue](../README.md#python-software-foundation)

Python is a popular high-level programming language used by scientists, developers,
and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more
effectively. The Python Software Foundation serves as an umbrella organization to a
variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the
development of the Python language.

This year, our sub-orgs are:
* dipy (computational neuroanatomy, focusing mainly on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) analysis)
* mercurial (source control)
* mne-python (processing electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data)
* pysal (Python Spatial Analysis Library)
* scipy (fundamental routines for scientific computing)
* scrapinghub (information retrieval and manipulation)
* securedrop (secure whistleblower submission system)
* statmodels (data analysis, statistics and econometrics)

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: This template is available with more examples/explanation at http://python-gsoc.org/studenttemplate.html

# Sub-org name
e.g. Dipy, MNE-Python. Please include this in the title of your application in the system as well.  __Projects without a valid sub-org may be lost or rejected.__  

# Student info
* Name/Nicknames (e.g. on github, irc):
* Email, telephone, alternate contact methods: 
* Time Zone:
* GSoC Blog (you will be asked to blog about your project)

# Code sample:
* Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org. Must be publicly available and your own work. Applications without a valid code sample will be rejected.

# Project info
* Proposal Title:  Include the name of your sub-org and explain in a few words what you plan to do.
* Proposal Abstract:
* Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline:
  * Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. All pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during community bonding. 

# Other commitments
Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period? For example: Exams, classes, jobs, holidays, weddings. Be honest: we can work around minor scheduling issues, but if you lie about your availability and then fall behind on your work you will be failed.

* Have you applied with any other organizations? If so, do you have a preferred project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one organization decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
