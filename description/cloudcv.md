CloudCV is an open source cloud platform led by graduate students and faculty at the Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Georgia Tech, with the aim of making AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.
  
CloudCV consists of three major platforms: 

**Origami** is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.

**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.

**EvalAI** is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.
