We are AerospaceResearch.net, a small team of space makers solving space problems together with Small Satellite Student Society University o Stuttgart (KSat e.V.) and the Cosmic Dust Team.

In 2011, we started as a student group at the University of Stuttgart to provide massive computing power with our distributed computting platform Constellation to everyone needing it for space simulations. Over time, we attracted international young professionals of the space industry and the local maker community and thus becoming a full fletched citizen science project.

We are a community project of several Projects working of different Teams in Stuttgart and globally. Together with the Small Satellite Student Society University o Stuttgart (KSat e.V.) , the Distributed Ground Station Network Team at the Institute for Photogrammetry and the Cosmic Dust Team of the Institute for Space Systems at University of Stuttgart, we are working on the rover mission ROACH crawling for maintenance reasons on the outer hull of a sounding rocket while coasting in near space, tracking cubesats faster than US NORAD and simulating cometary dust particles for the IMEX project of the European Space Agency (ESA).

We are a small organization but having impact within out space community and helping realizing space exploration by creativity and open access. We are open for everybody interested in space for the 
betterment of everybody.
