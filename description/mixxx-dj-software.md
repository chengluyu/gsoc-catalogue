[Back to catalogue](../README.md#mixxx-dj-software)

Mixxx is a free, cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) DJ application that allows users to play multiple sound files at the same time and create smooth transitions between them. It began as one of the earliest digital DJ applications in 2001 for a PhD thesis project. Since then, Mixxx has steadily grown to a powerful program that supports a wide variety of DJ hardware. Our mission is to provide users with beautiful, intuitive DJ software with features that rival and lead proprietary DJ software such as Traktor, Serato, Rekordbox, and Virtual DJ.

As a contributor to the Mixxx project you will:

* Write code that is used by millions of DJs worldwide.
* Learn the tricks of trade in cross-platform deployment -- your feature will ship to users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Learn about how to write performance-optimized code where microseconds make a difference.
* Work with a quirky team of hackers, DJs and artists.

Working on Mixxx is a great way to get involved in open-source, learn valuable skills that look great on a resume, and have a fun time doing it.
