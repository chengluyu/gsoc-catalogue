The DBpedia project is aiming to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects. This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.

DBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.

DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about.

We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Would you like to apply for our projects? Please follow this rough guideline:

1) Subscribe to the DBpedia-GSoC mailing list: https://tinyurl.com/y7cfbr8n All GSoC related questions must go through this list.

2) Introduce yourself via the list. Tell us who you are, what you do, what you know and your project choice.

3) Read carefully through the ideas we proposed and see if any of these suit you. If you like to submit your own idea, please do so very early.

4) It should be the ultimate goal of your proposal to convince us that you have a good grasp of your project and that with our help you will be able to handle the challenges. You have to have a specific code-plan. Get as much information as possible for the ideas you like.

5) Work on some of the warm-up tasks we suggest.

6) Ask or answer questions on http://support.dbpedia.org (not GSoC related questions there please).

7) Write your proposal. Use the template we suggest and try to be as specific as possible. Focus especially on the timeline. The template is available here: http://wiki.dbpedia.org/gsoc2018
