# [GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

[Back to catalogue](../README.md#gnu-compiler-collection-gcc)

The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it respects the user's freedom.

We strive to provide regular, high quality releases, which we want to work well on a variety of native and cross targets (including GNU/Linux), and encourage everyone to contribute changes or help testing GCC. Our sources are readily and freely available via SVN and weekly snapshots.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Students applying for a GCC Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project need to have experience with C/C++ and should have at least some theoretical background in the area of compilers and compiler optimizations.

First, you need to select a project.  If you have been following GCC development, you might have an idea of your own.  Otherwise, you can go to https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode and pick an idea there. 

While selecting a project, do not hesitate to ask questions or request more details from the community by email to the gcc@gcc.gnu.org mialing list (you can subscribe at https://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html) with the string "GSoC" in the email subject or on our #gcc IRC channel at irc.oftc.net.  Please note that the mailing list does not accept HTML messages, you must set your email client to plain text.

After you believe you have selected and/or refined the project idea, please make sure you send us an email about your intention to apply to the gcc@gcc.gnu.org mailing list with the string "GSoC" in the email subject, in addition to any general required steps to apply to the GSoC program.

Last but not least, the GCC is owned by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), as such, all contributors must assign their copyright to the FSF before any of their changes are accepted. The copyright assignment process is described on pages:
