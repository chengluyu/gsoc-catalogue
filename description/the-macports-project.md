# [The MacPorts Project](https://www.macports.org/)

[Back to catalogue](../README.md#the-macports-project)

MacPorts is a ports collection and packaging system for macOS. Created in 2002 as DarwinPorts, we have an ever-growing collection of ports (currently over 22000), many of which accept multiple configuration variants. MacPorts itself works on both PowerPC and Intel Macs, running OS X 10.4 through macOS 10.13, and many ports support a similar breadth of systems.
As one of the primary means of building and installing open source software on macOS, MacPorts is an important interface between Mac operating systems and the rest of the open source world, greatly simplifying the task of compiling and installing open-source software on your Mac.

# Application Instructions
