# Why LuaRocks?

Lua is a tiny yet powerful programming language, a tiny yet powerful language used anywhere from embedded systems, to AI, to networking, to MMORPGs. The secret to its success is its _embeddability_: Lua is a tiny portable core than can be adapted to any project.

The flip-side to this is that Lua itself does not come with many libraries, it features only the bare minimum. Enter LuaRocks: by using it to  install additional packages called "rocks", LuaRocks turbo-charges Lua, making it a suitable language for any field.

# The package repository

In the [luarocks.org](http://luarocks.org) repository one can find packages for all sorts of areas. LuaRocks also allows third-party projects to host their own package repositories (either in [luarocks.org](http://luarocks.org) or in their own servers), so that LuaRocks can work as the plugin manager to their project.

# The build system

LuaRocks also doubles as a portable build system for compiling Lua modules. It abstracts away platform differences and allows module developers using Lua or C to distribute Lua extensions that can build in any modern operating system.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Thank you for your interest in LuaRocks! 

To apply as a student for GSoC, follow these steps:

1. Take a look at the [ideas list](http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/gsoc/ideas2018.html) for this year's project and see if anything interests you. If you have a new idea of your own, we are eager to hear about it too!
2. Come talk to us in our [gitter chat](http://gitter.im/luarocks/luarocks)! Say hello and tell us what you are interested in working on! 
3. If you are interested in a [project from the list](http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/gsoc/ideas2018.html), contact the mentor via their email indicated in that page. If you are coming up with your own project, tell us about it in Gitter and we will match you with a potential mentor.
4. When contacting the mentor, fill in the [student application](http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/gsoc/apply2018.html) and send that along in the email.
5. The mentor will probably ask you to perform some minor task to assess your suitability for the project, and if the project is a good fit for you, the mentor will guide you on writing your final project application to be submitted to GSoC.

Good luck!
