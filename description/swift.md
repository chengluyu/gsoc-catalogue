Swift is a high-performance system programming language. It has a clean and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code and frameworks, and is memory safe by default.

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Each proposal should contain the following sections:

* **Project title**
* **Detailed project description**
  * This is a more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences).  This should outline both the underlying problem trying to be solved as well as an elaboration of the technical approach to tackle that problem.
* **Expected outcomes/benefits/deliverables**
* **Implementation plan**
   * This should outline how the work will be approached in stages, with milestones along the way that can be used to both evaluate the technical direction of the work as well as how much progress has been made.
