[Back to catalogue](../README.md#timvideosus)

[**TimVideos.us** is a _group_ of exciting projects](https://code.timvideos.us) which together create a system for doing both _recording and live event streaming_ for **conferences**, **meetings**, **user groups** and **other** presentations. 

We hope that, through our _projects_, the costs and expertise currently required to produce live streaming events will be reduced to near zero. We wish to develop a system where everyone has the ability to record presentations and host live remote participants across the globe.

Our projects include simple web development, to real time live video mixing software, to hardware and electronics! One of our biggest projects is the [HDMI2USB.tv project](https://hdmi2usb.tv).

## HDMI2USB.tv: Open video capture hardware + firmware

The HDMI2USB project develops affordable hardware options to record and stream HD videos (from HDMI & DisplayPort sources) for conferences, meetings and user groups.

We are currently developing our own hardware (the [Numato Opsis](https://hdmi2usb.tv/numato-opsis/)), and also [provide firmware](https://hdmi2usb.tv/firmware/) for various prototyping boards.

HDMI2USB started in 2013, and is an active ongoing project in its third iteration of hardware prototyping. Today you can download working firmware and have real capture happen. Get involved in contributing code both to the capture software + FPGA stack

Our aim is this becomes the defacto, incredibly affordable and easy to use video recording hardware for conferences, meetings and user groups worldwide.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: First, **please start by reading our [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/)** which includes a lot of important information on how to ask for help and writing a good proposal.

Once you have read the [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) you can go to the [contributing page](https://code.timvideos.us/contribute/) which will try and figure out which project best fits your interests and skills. The page will eventually take you to our [getting started issue tracker](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues) which includes our most fleshed out ideas for projects, many of which are suitable for GSoC.

We encourage students to figure out which idea excites them the most! A student who is interested in their project is more likely to write a good proposal and get accepted. As selecting a project or understanding an idea can be hard, we recommend you come join us [on IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=timvideos) and talk to us further about them. Good students are engaged with the community before GSoC even starts!

Once you have found a project you are interested in working on, go to the issue tracker for the project and look for bugs marked "Good First Bug". These bugs are simple enough that you should with some help be able try to fix them. Submitting a bug fix shows that you have understood the project enough to get things set up and while **not** required is a strong positive signal we will use when assessing your application.

As mentioned in the [GSoC advice page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/) page, mentors and the community are happy to review applications and give feedback. This will drastically improve the quality of your application and give you a better chance of being accepted.
