[Back to catalogue](../README.md#godot-engine)

[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as mobile (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5 via WebAssembly) platforms.

Godot is completely [free and open source](http://github.com/godotengine/godot) under the very permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. It is supported by the  [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) not-for-profit.

With its major 3.0 release in January 2018 after more than 18 months of development, Godot is establishing itself as a major player not only among free and open source engine, but also next to the proprietary engines which currently dominate the market (Unity3D, Unreal Engine, Game Maker, etc.).

Hundreds of game and [engine developers](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/graphs/contributors) from all over the world contribute to its success daily by extending the engine, fixing bugs, writing documentation, providing support on community channels and, last but not least, developing their own great games with Godot!

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: To apply for an internship at [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), we encourage you to first get familiar with the community ([channels](https://godotengine.org/community)), review the ideas list and [current roadmap](https://github.com/godotengine/roadmap) and think about what you'd like to work on (it can be your own proposal). To ensure that it's relevant, discuss it with Godot developers and use their feedback to write your application.

To apply formally, we ask that you send an email to gsoc@godotengine.org with:
- A one-pager describing your technical proposal, why it would be a good fit for the engine and rough ideas on how it could be done
- A (short) cover letter, describing why you would like to be a GSoC student at Godot
- A résumé mentioning your current studies, and if applicable experience with free and open source software

As mentioned, you are really encourage to get in touch with Godot contributors before applying to put all chances on your side. We will not pre-approve proposals before a formal application following the GSoC timeline and rules, but we can give our assessment of the relevance of your ideas for the project, and their concordance with its philosophy and roadmap. The preferred channel to discuss with developers is [#godotengine-devel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#godotengine-devel) on the Freenode IRC network.
