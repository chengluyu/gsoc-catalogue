Elastic is the world's leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security, and analytics use cases.
Founded in 2012 in Amsterdam by the people behind Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene, Elastic set forth a vision that search can solve a plethora of data problems. The origins of the company start back in 2010, when Shay Banon wrote the first lines of Elasticsearch and open sourced it as a distributed search engine. Since then, the creators of the open source tools Kibana, Logstash, and Beats have joined the Elastic family, rounding out a product portfolio known as the Elastic Stack, which is used by millions of developers around the world. Elastic has headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Mountain View, California. The Elastic family unites more than 700 employees across 35 countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.
