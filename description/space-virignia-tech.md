The mission of Space@VT  is to provide forefront research, scholarship, instruction, and educational outreach in the broad fields of space science and engineering. A key focus of the research and educational effort will be the science, technological impact, and utilization of the geo-space environment.

Space@VT strives to utilize a holistic approach to space research and space mission development by combining theory, modeling, observation and education that employ advanced computational techniques, space instrument and space systems development, ground-based instrument development, and experimental data acquisition, analysis and interpretation within a research program that fully involves graduate and undergraduate students.

Space@VT focuses on both graduate and undergraduate education in the broad fields of space science and engineering. Space@VT prepares students to become leaders in their chosen fields whether they are in the private, government, or academic sectors. Space@VT educates university students to make important contributions to society as a whole.

Space@VT works towards engaging underrepresented groups in science and engineering in general and space science and engineering in particular. This engagement includes providing research and educational opportunities and experiences for middle school, high school, and college level underrepresented students. Space@VT also develops joint research and educational ventures with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs).

The vision of Space@VT is to be a premiere space research organization of international caliber advancing the broad research, educational, and outreach mission of Virginia Tech.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: We are an organization where everyone is passionate and enthusiastic about their work and we expect the same from the students. We recommend the students to go through our list of ideas to get a notion of the projects we work on. However, it is not required to pick an idea from the list, you are welcome to suggest your own ideas as long as they are relevant to space science. We expect the students to have basic programming skills. Python is our preferred programming language but not a requirement to apply as some projects may not require python at all. It is not required to have a knowledge of space science or the instruments listed in the ideas page, you'll learn about them when you start working with us. If you are interested in some of the ideas, contact the corresponding mentors (contact info shared in ideas page) as soon as possible to discuss them further. Finally, feel free to contact Debbie Collins (collinsd@vt.edu) or any of the mentors for general queries.
