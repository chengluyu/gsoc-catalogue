mlpack is a C++ machine learning library with emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease-of-use. Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users. This is done by providing a set of command-line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C++ API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.

As a result of this approach, mlpack outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins; the handful of publications relating to mlpack demonstrate this.

mlpack is developed by contributors from around the world. It is released free of charge, under the 3-clause BSD License. (Versions older than 1.0.12 were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License: LGPL, version 3.)

mlpack bindings for R are provided by the RcppMLPACK project.
