Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

At Mozilla, weâ€™re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Our list of projects, including information about how to apply for existing projects or propose your own, is available here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode18

If you're interested in participating in Mozilla's GSoC program you can choose from the list on that page, but don't limit yourself to what you find there! You're welcome to submit a proposal for your own idea. You should look at the guidelines, though, and discuss your ideas or application in the #introduction channel on IRC.Mozilla.org. This discussion is important: GSoC projects must have a supporting member of the Mozilla community to evaluate and mentor them as part of the application. If you go this route, please tag your proposal "original-proposal".

Thank you.
