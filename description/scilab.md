## What is Scilab ?

Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications.  By using matrix-based computation, dynamic typing, and automatic memory management, many numerical problems may be expressed in a reduced number of code lines, as compared to similar solutions using traditional languages, such as Fortran, C, or C++.

## What does Scilab do ?

Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions. It has a high level programming language allowing access to advanced data structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions. 

A large number of functionalities is included in Scilab:

* Maths & Simulation

For usual engineering and science applications including mathematical operations and data analysis. 

* 2-D & 3-D Visualization

Graphics functions to visualize, annotate and export data and many ways to create and customize various types of plots and charts. 

* Optimization

Algorithms to solve constrained and unconstrained continuous and discrete optimization problems. 

* Statistics

Tools to perform data analysis and modeling 

* Control System Design & Analysis

Standard algorithms and tools for control system study 

* Signal Processing

Visualize, analyze and filter signals in time and frequency domains. 

* Application Development

Increase Scilab native functionalities and manage data exchanges with external tools.

* Xcos - Hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator

Modeling mechanical systems, hydraulic circuits, control systems...

## Scilab as a platform

Thanks to its ability to interconnect with third-party technologies and applications, Scilab can also act as a unique platform to bring together codes written in different programming languages in a single, unified language, thus facilitating their distribution, their back-up and use.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: The following procedure are applied to students:
 1. Pick up a project you are interested in the list of Ideas of development. It is important to like your subject. _Some projects have a high priority. Selecting one of them increases your chances to be selected._
 2. Contact the Scilab GSoC mailing list if you have some questions on a subject (please, do not contact directly the mentor). We will update the corresponding wiki pages. Don't hesitate to do so. We do agree that some pages have too few information.
 3. If needed, join us on IRC to get in touch with us and/or ask questions. Note that most of Scilab developers are in the France timezone (UTC+1)

*If you need to get in touch with the potential mentor of a subject, drop an email to gsoc@lists.scilab.org*

We require students to build Scilab before submitting a project. It is easy to do. Students should send us a screenshot of the Scilab console with the updated banner containing his name. Building your own module (toolbox) is also appreciated, especially if it provides an actual feature (even a single function) and if it is integrated in ATOMS. Applicants providing patches fixing reported bugs (even easy one) will be considered with care. Applicants can also fix issues reported by Coverity. If you do so, please indicate it in your proposal.
