[Back to catalogue](../README.md#open-roberta-lab)

### Introduction
The Roberta Initiative “Learning with Robots” was started more than 15 years ago by Fraunhofer IAIS in Germany with the objective to get kids interested in technology and science by constructing and programming robotic kits. The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.

### The lab
The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to programming robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <https://lab.open-roberta.org/> is online and has had more than 100.000+ visits in 2017 across 135 countries.

The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the form of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 7 different robot plugins:
* EV3 LEGO Mindstorms 
* NXT LEGO Mindstorms
* BBC micro:bit 
* Calliope mini
* Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based
* NAO, a humanoide robot
* Bob3

### Outlook
While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Before you apply, please have a look at what we have already developed. Play around with our [lab](https://lab.open-roberta.org), fork the robertalab repository, try to install and run it locally. Feel free to ask us for help, if necessary.

If you have already committed to an Open Source project, please provide a link to this in your application. If you haven't, no problem, but maybe you can provide us some other samples of your programming experience. Also student's projects are welcome.

Have a look at our list of proposals for GSOC. If you have another good idea, don't hesitate to come up with your own project proposal. Maybe you would like to discuss it with us before you apply, please use our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-roberta).
