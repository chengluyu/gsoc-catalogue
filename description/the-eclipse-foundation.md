[Back to catalogue](../README.md#the-eclipse-foundation)

Eclipse is an open source community that's focused around key principles of transparency, openness, and vendor neutrality. Transparency is a relatively easy concept to understand: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest. While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called "level playing field").

Naturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over [three hundred](https://projects.eclipse.org/) open source projects covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody. 

Eclipse projects build technology in areas such as [Internet of Things](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things), [Programming Languages and IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language), and [Runtimes](https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime) like Jetty and [EE4J](http://www.eclipse.org/ee4j) (currently known as Java EE).

For those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on [Science](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science) where researches from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.

You've probably heard about our market-leading software development tools; we have that, and so much more...

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Your project proposal should include the following.

**Abstract** Provide a short description of your proposal. Thing of this as your "elevator pitch"; how would you describe your project during a 15 second elevator ride?

**Experience** What existing work have you already done in this area? Where possible, provide pointers to contributions that you've already made to related work. 

**Background** What work do you expect to do in the time leading up to the start of the GSoC programme? What background information will you need to get started and what do you plan to do to gather that information?

**Deliverables** What do you expect to deliver? Be as specific as possible.

**Schedule** List a series of at least three milestones and what you expect to have accomplished for each.

**Expectations** What do you expect from your mentor? What help are you going to need?
