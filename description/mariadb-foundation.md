[Back to catalogue](../README.md#mariadb-foundation)

MariaDB Server began as a database server that offers drop-in replacement functionality to MySQL and has grown into being a default "MySQL" in many Linux distributions. MariaDB Server is built by some of the original authors of MySQL, with assistance from the broader community of free and open source software developers. In addition to the core functionality of MySQL, MariaDB Server offers a rich set of feature enhancements including alternate storage engines, advanced server optimizations, and other features. MariaDB Server is feature enhanced, community developed and backward compatible with MySQL. MariaDB Server ships in all major Linux distributions and is backed by the MariaDB Foundation.

MariaDB offers a fully synchronous replication solution, MariaDB Galera Cluster, an intelligent proxy called MariaDB MaxScale, and a data analytics solution MariaDB ColumnStore. MariaDB Server also has LGPL client libraries for C, Java and ODBC.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Consider starting from [GSoC FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) or [GSoC Student Manual](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/guide). Join #maria channel on Freenode and maria-developers@lists.launchpad.net.
Your proposal should contain at least those parts:
* _Who are you?_ Tell something about yourself, like your name, education, email address and irc nickname, GitHub profile, your contributions to Open Source projects, and so on.
* _What do you want to do?_ Describe the project, as you'd do it to a user. Changes in behavior, new SQL commands, etc. Do not talk about function names, algorithms or data structures here.
* _How do you want to do it?_ Here you should describe your project in term of internals, function names, algorithms and data structures. What do you want to change and how. Try to show that you know what you're talking about and not simply copied from the project ideas page.
* _When do you plan to do what?_ Present the timeline here. What will be ready when? Structure your work so that you could test new code immediately, implement your project in small steps that could be tested incrementally. Reserve at least 40% of the time for testing.
Note, you will almost certainly write a better proposal and will improve your chance of being accepted if you'll discuss your project first on the mailing list or the irc.
After you've filed the proposal, you might receive a reply from a mentor with a test assignment. It will be a small task related to MariaDB code base that will allow you to prove your abilities in C/C++ and setting up a development environment
