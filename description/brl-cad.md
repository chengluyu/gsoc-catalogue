This is the place for computer graphics, 2D and 3D geometry, solid modeling, CAx (CAD/CAM/CAE/etc), visualization, and high-performance computing!

BRL-CAD is participating as an umbrella organization with several other open source computer-aided technologies (CAx) including:

* BRL-CAD is a solid modeling system for 3D geometry, ray tracing, and geometric analysis.
* LibreCAD is a 2D modeling system specializing in blueprint-style drawings and draftings.
* STEPcode is a geometry file parser generator for the CAx data exchange ISO standard.
* OpenSCAD is a solid 3D modeler with a rich syntax for programmable geometry.
* LinuxCNC provides computer control of milling machines, lathes, 3d printers, robots, and more.
* FreeCAD provides parametric 3D modeling with engineering functionality like FEM and CAM.
* Slic3r is a 3D model processor for generating printing instructions for 3D printers.

We are part of a large open source community that makes tools to help you make and analyze things.  CAx software is fundamentally different from content modeling software such as Blender, Maya, and 3D Studio used for making movies and pretty pictures.  CAx software like AutoCAD, Pro/Engineer, CATIA, and BRL-CAD are for everything else.  Our primary development focus areas include:

* CAD (design),
* CAM (manufacturing),
* CAE (engineering),
* solid modeling (analysis), and
* computer graphics (visualization).
