[Back to catalogue](../README.md#free-and-open-source-silicon-foundation)

We are a group of developers and open hardware enthusiasts from the open source silicon community, that formed the FOSSi Foundation. It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.

Our goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single "IP blocks" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](https://librecores.org).

Beside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.

With those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of "open source chips". Please find a list of a few ideas, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.

Google Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference [ORConf](https://orconf.org) with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Gdansk, Poland, on September 21-23.

# Application Instructions

* Twitter: Please choose projects that match your experience level and abilities. We highly encourage you to submit your own proposals. As we are an umbrella organization, the individual projects manage their own requirements. Please get in touch with the proposed mentors very early as some of the projects may require you to prove your capabilities.

Generally, we highly encourage you to get in touch with the projects early and thoroughly. The proposed mentory are happy to support you with understanding the proposed projects. They will also guide you on milestones and other planning parts of your application. You should be confident to being able to conduct the project and ask as many questions as you have!
