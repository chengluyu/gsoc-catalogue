Understanding health and sustainability is of increasing importance as people and organizations rely on open source projects in their daily work. The CHAOSS project is specifically aimed at producing integrated, open source software for analyzing software development, and definition of standards and models used in that software in specific use cases; establishing implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and producing standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world.
