The Joomla Community manages two major software projects, the Joomla Content Management System and the Joomla Framework.

* The Joomla! CMS is a PHP based application that powers about 3.2% of the web, 6.5% of all CMS based websites, as well as many intranets.
* The Joomla Framework is a PHP application framework used for building web and command line applications, and is the basis of the Joomla CMS.

Each of these projects has hundreds of contributors, a set of working groups and teams, and a leadership group. These are coordinated by the [Production Department](https://volunteers.joomla.org/departments/production/ "Joomla Production Department"). This is an umbrella application for the two projects.

The Joomla CMS and Joomla Framework are community driven FOSS projects developed and maintained by an international community encompassing over 200 countries. Joomla is used by millions of websites and web applications ranging from the hobbyist, professional web developer, to large enterprises, for both the World Wide Web and intranets.

The Joomla Project is a community effort which strives to engage contributors from diverse backgrounds and varying interests and skills in building and supporting great software together. The [mission, vision and values](https://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/mission-vision-and-values.html "Joomla Mission vision and values") of the Joomla Project reflect this. 

The official sponsoring organisation is Open Source Matters (OSM), the not for profit organization that manages financial and legal issues for the Joomla Project. A team of experienced people drawn from many areas of the project will manage the 2018 GSoC project for Joomla.
