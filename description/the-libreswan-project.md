Libreswan implements the IKE and IPsec standards for VPN. These standards have been created and are still maintained at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the IPsecME Working Group. Libreswan is used as a remote access VPN as well as cloud encryption. It is known for its goal of Opportunistic Encryption which aims to encrypt the entire internet by default.
